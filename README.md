# Quant Notes

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of notes created during my journey through a quantitative finance program. The notes are written in Markdown (`.md`) format and are designed to be viewed and navigated using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), a powerful knowledge management tool.

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a personal backup of my work. However, if anyone is interested in exploring these notes, they are welcome to do so.

## Features

- **Interlinked Notes**: All notes are interconnected using Obsidian's linking system, enabling smooth navigation between topics.
- **Organized Structure**: Notes are categorized into directories (`Encounters`, `Atlas`, `Calendar`, etc.) for clarity and easy access.
- **Rich Content**: Includes mathematical derivations, financial models, coding snippets, and key concepts from the program.
- **Dynamic Updates**: These notes evolve as I continue learning and refining my understanding of quantitative finance.

## Folder Structure

- **Encounters**: Newest notes, yet to be organized.
- **Atlas**: Navigation map to all general subsections (MOCs)
- **Calendar**: Timeline-specific notes and key milestones during the program.
- **Cards**: All single-topic notes, sorted in folders by atlas
- **Extras**: Supplementary material such as images, external references, or additional resources.
- **Spaces**: General ideas or brainstorming areas.
