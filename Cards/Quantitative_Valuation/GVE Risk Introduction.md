# GVE with Risk
## Case 1: A risky cashflow in 1 period
$$\text{GVE:} \quad r V_0 + k V_0 = -V_0 + \mu$$
$$V_0 = \frac{\mu}{1 + (r + k)}$$
- Where $\mu$ is the expected risky cash flow
- Risk measure = cost of investment $V_0$
- Solution here is basically to increase the risk premium by k to account for risk
## Case 2: risk not proportional to asset value
$$\text{GVE:} \quad r V_0 + k \sigma = -V_0 + \mu$$
$$V_0 = \frac{\mu - k \sigma}{1 + r}$$
- $(\mu - k \sigma)$ is the risk neutral cash flow
- Basis of the [[Elon Musk Problem]]
