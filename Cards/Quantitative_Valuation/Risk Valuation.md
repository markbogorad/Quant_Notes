# Risk in Valuation
- **Risk Capital** -> how much capital one puts at risk. 
	- Alternative measure to returns (logic behind sharpe ratio) vs cash return standard
- Diversification -> % risk declines but cash risk actually increases
	- Measure is subjective, can use dollar risk or % risk, doesn't matter so long as you accept the number
- Investment bank project acceptance rule of thumb
	- Accept a short term project only if the **expected profit exceeds 25% of the risk measure**
## GVE
- Risk in [[General Valuation Equation (GVE)]]
	- Required return on risk capital
	- Think of this as compensation for "waiting and worrying"
