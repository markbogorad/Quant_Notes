# Elon Musk Problem
> Suppose Elon has $44 billion in assets in total. A bank offers Elon the following deal:
		$5.00 now
		50% chance of receiving an additional $44 billion in one year
		50% chance of paying $44 billion in one yea
		The risk free rate is assumed to be 0
	Should he take the deal?

- Addresses the failure of NPV models -> NPV would suggest a positive NPV without considering the magnitude of funds invested
- Using [[General Valuation Equation (GVE)]]
	- Assumes a bank says the standard deviation is 0.25
$$rV_0 + k\sigma = (0-V_0) + E[C1]$$
$$0.1V_0 + (44Bn)0.25 = (0-V_0) + 0.5(44Bn + (-44Bn)) = -10Bn$$
- Suggests this deal actually costs 10Bn
