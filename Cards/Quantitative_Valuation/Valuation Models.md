# Popular Valuation Models
**Liquidation Value**: 
- How much the highest available bidder will pay for an asset if sold in the near future.
- Used more by lenders -> like to ensure collateral is enough to cover their investment
- An accounting concept

**Replacement Cost**: 
- How much it would cost to replace or rebuild the asset.
- Considers overpaying

**Comparable Value**: 
- The value of comparable assets, with valuation adjustments for imperfect comparables.
- Ex: 2 similar apartment complexes
- An accounting concept

**Benchmark Valuation**: 
- Similar to comparables, but allowing a wide range of assets and contracts to be used to replicate the cash flows of the asset as well as possible, using securities and assets whose prices are known.
- Ex: choosing relevant sectors and stock to value AMZN

**Discounted Cash Flow or Present Value**: 
- The present value of the net appreciation and cash flows that an asset creates incrementally; or, the amount of money one would have to set aside at the prescribed discount rate to produce a given pattern of future cash flows.
- Considers synergies
- Ex: an oil company adding a well will value that well differently vs a new entrant
	- For oil company --> its adding 1 more to say 50 wells and seeing that impact
	- For a new entrant its the main focus of a project

**Portfolio Valuation**: 
- The increase in the value of a portfolio as a result of the addition of the asset.
