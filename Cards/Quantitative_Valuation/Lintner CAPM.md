# Lintner CAPM
- Lintner derives expected returns and standard deviations, which are functions of risk
- says you change portfolio risk with each asset and it includes cost of idiosyncratic risk
- Lintner re-arranged to start capm with cash flow, derive expected returns, and reach sharpe
- assumes risk is not proportional to asset value -> need to do k sigma and risk is sigma - risk capital
