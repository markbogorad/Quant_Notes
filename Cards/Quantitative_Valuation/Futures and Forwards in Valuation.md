# Futures and Forwards in Valuation
- The value of forwards and futures are 0 at inception
	- A [[General Valuation Equation (GVE)]] concept
	- Value does not equal price, and expected value refers to price!
- Pros of forwards
	- anonymous trading and can do block trades
- Prepaid forward
	- put money aside to buy the asset in future. Ensures you can buy it deferred
- Reversing positions in forward valuation
	- Its not the same as long and short stock. 
	- There is a **time to the future factor**, where the variation until then affects your price
		- Value of reversing the position = $V(t) = (F_t - F_0) e^{-r(T - t)}$
- Leverage
	- When cash flows are risk free, sharpe ratios are the same between leveraged and not leveraged securities
