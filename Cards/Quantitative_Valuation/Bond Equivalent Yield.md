# Bond Equivalent Yield
- The bond-equivalent yield is a simplified annualized return calculation, often used for comparability with other fixed-income securities. 
- It does not account for **compounding** (reinvesting coupons) but instead annualizes a semiannual yield as follows
$$\text{BEY} = \frac{\text{Semiannual Coupon Rate} \times 2}{\text{Bond's Face Value}}$$
