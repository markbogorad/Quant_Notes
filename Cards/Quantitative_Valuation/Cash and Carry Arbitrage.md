# Cash and Carry Arbitrage
- If the price of a future is trading **above** its theoretical price of $S_0 e ^{(r+u-y)T}$

- **Step 1**: Buy the underlying asset in the spot market.
- **Step 2**: Simultaneously sell (short) a futures contract on the asset.
- **Step 3**: Hold the asset until the futures contract expires. 
- **Step 4**: Deliver the asset at the futures contractâ€™s higher price to fulfill the short futures position.

The profit is made from the difference between the higher futures price and the lower spot price, after accounting for any holding (carry) costs, such as storage and financing.

## Reverse Cash-and-Carry Arbitrage
- If price is trading below theoretical

- **Step 1**: Short-sell the underlying asset in the spot market.
- **Step 2**: Simultaneously buy a futures contract on the asset.
- **Step 3**: When the contract expires, take delivery via the futures contract at the lower futures price.
- **Step 4**: Use the asset from the futures contract to close out the spot market short position.

The profit here is the difference between the higher spot price and the lower futures price, adjusted for carry costs.

These strategies work well when futures prices deviate from fair value, allowing arbitrageurs to lock in profits by capitalizing on these temporary inefficiencies.
