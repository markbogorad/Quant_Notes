# Process v Random Variable
- **Process**
	- [[Stochastic Process]]
	- A stochastic process is a collection of random variables **indexed by time** or another parameter. It describes a system that evolves over time in a probabilistic manner.
		- **Key difference: Process has a time component included (retesting an event again and again)**
	- Types of Processes
		- Markov Process: A process where the future state depends only on the current state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it.
			- [[Markov Switching Models]]
		- Poisson Process: A process that counts the number of events in fixed intervals of time or space, with each event happening independently of the others.
		- Wiener Process (Brownian Motion): A continuous-time process with applications in finance and physics.
- **Random variable**
	- A random variable is a function that assigns a numerical value to each outcome in a sample space of a random experiment. It quantifies the outcomes of a random process and maps these outcomes to the real number line.
	- *Discrete Random Variable*: Takes on a finite or countable number of values (e.g., rolling a die).
	- *Continuous Random Variable*: Takes on an infinite number of values within a range (e.g., the height of people in a population)
