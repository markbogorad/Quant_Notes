# Law of Large Numbers
- The Law of Large Numbers states that as the number of observations of independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables increases, the sample average **will get closer to the expected value (mean) of the population.**
$$\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \to \mu \quad \text{almost surely as } n \to \infty.$$
- An example of almost sure convergence --> [[Convergence of a Sequence of Random Variables]]
- If you have a large random sample, the average will be close to the [[Expectation]] of each $X_i$
	- Comes from [[Chebyshev's Inequality]]
