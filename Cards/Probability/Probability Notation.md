# Important Symbols and Notation
1. $( P )$: The probability measure, often used as $( P(A) )$ to denote the probability of event $( A )$.

2. $( \varphi )$ or $( \phi )$: Often used to represent the standard normal [[Probability Density Function (PDF)]], particularly in the context of the [[Normal Distribution]]

3. $( \Phi(x) )$: The [[Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)]] of the standard [[Normal Distribution]]. It represents the probability that a standard normal variable is less than or equal to $( x )$.

4. $( p )$: Typically denotes the probability of success in a [[Bernoulli Random Variable & Processes]] trial or the probability associated with a [[Binomial Distribution]]. In [[Hypothesis Testing]], $( p )$-value is the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.

5. $( q )$: Usually denotes the probability of failure in a [[Bernoulli Random Variable & Processes]] trial, with $( q = 1 - p )$.

6. $( \mu )$: Represents the expected value (mean) of a random variable, particularly in the context of normal distributions.

7. $( \sigma )$: The standard deviation of a random variable. It is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values.

8. $( \sigma^2 )$: The variance of a random variable, which is the square of the standard deviation.

9. $( \lambda )$: Often used in the context of the [[Poisson Distribution]] to represent the **rate parameter**, which is the expected number of events in a fixed interval.

10. $( \theta )$: A general symbol used to denote parameters in probability distributions, such as the mean, variance, or other defining characteristics of a distribution.

11. $( f_X(x) )$: [[Probability Density Function (PDF)]] for a continuous random variable $( X )$, representing the likelihood of different outcomes.

12. $( p_X(x) )$: [[Probability Mass Function (PMF)]] for a discrete random variable $( X )$, representing the probability that $( X )$ takes the value $( x )$.

13. $( \mathbb{P} )$: An alternative notation for probability, emphasizing the measure-theoretic approach.

14. $( \mathbb{E}[X] )$: The expected value (mean) of the random variable $( X )$. See [[Expectation]]

15. $( \text{Var}(X) )$: The [[Variance]] of the random variable $( X )$.

16. $( \text{Cov}(X, Y) )$: The [[Covariance]] between two random variables $( X )$ and $( Y )$.

17. $( \rho_{X,Y} )$: The [[Correlation]] coefficient between two random variables $( X )$ and $( Y )$.
