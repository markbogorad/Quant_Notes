# Probability Mass Function
- A **probability mass function (PMF)** is a function that provides the probability that a discrete random variable takes on a specific value.
$$ p(x)=P(X=x) $$
- All this says is the probability that a random variable X will take on a value of x
## Example:
- Suppose $X$ is a random variable representing the outcome of rolling a fair six-sided die. The PMF of $X$ is:
$$p(x) = \begin{cases} 
\frac{1}{6} & \text{if } x \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
 $$

- This means that each of the numbers 1 through 6 has a probability of 1661​, and any other value has a probability of 0.
