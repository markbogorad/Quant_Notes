- Art of [[Encryption]] (scrambling information so it's only available to person and recipient)
	- Done with a **cipher** algorithm 
		- Cipher encrypts so other party can decrypt
		- Take message + key input (long number)
		- Can also alter the code via patterns (encrypt) and then undo the pattern on the other end
			- An issue if your code gets leaked, can be unlocked via [[Brute Force Attacks]]
				- *Brute force* is repeated trial and error to break into a program
- Used to send secure messages
