## The Stack
- Static memory storage (vs [[Dynamic Memory]])
- Uses a push and pop mechanism to insert and remove
- Stores each variable by function in a LIFO order
	- Highly structured and auto managed by CPU
		- Makes it fast
- Auto memory allocation and deallocation
- Fixed size at start of program
- ###### Cons:
	- Limited space due to fixed size (large variables can make it overflow)
	- No resizing elements (can do this on the heap dynamically though)
