# Agile Development
- A software engineering methodology that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback
- It promotes adaptive planning and development through iterative cycles known as sprints. 
- The main goal of Agile is to deliver small, workable pieces of software frequently, allowing for rapid response to changes and continuous improvement. ([[Python MOC]])

### Key Principles of Agile Development:
1. **Customer Collaboration:** Continuous involvement of customers to ensure the product meets their needs.
2. **Iterative Development:** Development is divided into small iterations or sprints, usually lasting 1-4 weeks.
3. **Flexibility:** Ability to adapt to changing requirements even late in the development process.
4. **Cross-functional Teams:** Teams consisting of members with different skills working together.
5. **Incremental Delivery:** Delivering functional parts of the software regularly.
6. **Continuous Feedback:** Regular feedback from stakeholders to improve the product.

### Popular Agile Frameworks:
- **Scrum:** Focuses on sprints and roles like Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team.
- **Kanban:** Uses visual boards to manage work in progress and improve process flow.
- **Extreme Programming (XP):** Emphasizes technical practices like test-driven development and pair programming.
