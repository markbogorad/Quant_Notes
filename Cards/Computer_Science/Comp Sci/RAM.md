- The center of [[Memory Management]], [[Dynamic Memory]]
- Stores live data (executables and other live stuff)
- Black squares -> this is where bits (memory) is stored
## Why its important
- Not enough memory will limit span of computer programs, causing integer overflow
	- Think of the [[Computer Fundamentals]] example with the lightbulbs. Small RAM means not enough lightbulbs means you can only make so many combinations out of your bits
- **Floating point imprecision** - no matter how much RAM you use, the computer will always make errors once you go far enough (decimal places) due to memory ending
## How to measure good RAM vs bad RAM
