# Type Casting
- similar to [[Static Cast]]
- A way to avoid truncation (ex: when division makes a 0.3 into just 0.0)
- Tells compiler to treat the integers as a float (or other data types)
## How it looks
```
int a;
int b;

float z = (float) x / (float) y
```
- (float) is the **type casting** of integer to float
