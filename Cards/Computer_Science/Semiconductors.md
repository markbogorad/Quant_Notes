- **Definition**: Materials with electrical conductivity between that of a conductor (like copper) and an insulator (like glass). They are the foundation for modern electronic devices because their conductive properties can be precisely controlled by doping and other processes.
- **Materials**: Silicon is the most commonly used material, though others like gallium arsenide are also used in specialized applications.
- **Types:**
	- [[CPU]]
	- [[GPU]]
	- [[RAM]] and other memory chips
	- System Chips (SoCs)
	- ASICs 
	- FPGAs
