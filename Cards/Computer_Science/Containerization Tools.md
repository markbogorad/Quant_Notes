# Containerization
- A lightweight form of virtualization that allows applications to run in isolated environments called containers
	- **This ensures that the application runs the same way regardless of where it is deployed.**
- #### Key Benefits of Containerization:
1. **Portability**: Containers can run on any system that supports the container runtime, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments (development, testing, production).
2. **Isolation**: Containers isolate applications from each other and from the host system, enhancing security and stability.
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Containers share the host system's kernel, making them more lightweight and efficient than traditional virtual machines.
4. **Scalability**: Containers can be easily scaled up or down to handle varying workloads.
