- Tools designed to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently
- **Common Types**
	- **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**: Software that interacts with end-users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. Examples include:
    - **Relational DBMS (RDBMS)**: Use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data. Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database.
    - **NoSQL DBMS**: Designed for specific data models and flexible schemas. Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.
	- **Data Warehouses**: Central repositories of integrated data from multiple sources, optimized for analysis and reporting. Examples: Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake.
	- **Data Lakes**: Storage repositories that hold vast amounts of raw data in its native format until needed. Often used for big data analytics. Examples: Hadoop, Azure Data Lake.
	- **Data Integration Tools**: Facilitate the movement, cleansing, and consolidation of data from various sources into a unified view. Examples: Apache NiFi, Talend, Informatica.
	- **Data Analytics and Business Intelligence (BI) Tools**: Enable the analysis and visualization of data to support decision-making. Examples: Tableau, Power BI, Looker.
	- **Data Governance and Security Tools**: Ensure data quality, privacy, and compliance with regulations. Examples: Collibra, Alation, IBM Guardium.
	- **Big Data Platforms**: Technologies that handle and process large volumes of data, often in distributed environments. Examples: Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark.
	- **Data Processing Frameworks**: Tools for processing and transforming data, often in real-time or batch modes. Examples: Apache Flink, Apache Beam.
	- [[Cloud Services]]: Managed services provided by cloud providers for storing, managing, and analyzing data. Examples: AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Microsoft Azure SQL Database.
