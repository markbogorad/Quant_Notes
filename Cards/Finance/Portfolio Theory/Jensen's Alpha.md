# Jensen's Alpha
- This is alpha from the [[CAPM]]
	- A measure of abnormal returns (above what CAPM predicted)
	- Also the deviation away from the security market line (SML)
- Positive alpha = outperforming, negative = underperforming
$$ \alpha = R_p - (R_f + \beta_p (R_m - R_f)) $$
- **Rp:** Portfolio return
- **Rf:** Risk free rate
- **Bp:** Portfolio beta
- **Rm:** Market returns
