- Compares the portfolio and the market as a benchmark
- The entire formula essentially compares the actual **excess return** of the portfolio to what the portfolio’s return would be if it assumed the market’s risk-return profile (normalized to the portfolio’s level of risk)
	- Result tells us how much more we earned compared to normal market prefomance
$$ M^2 = (R_p - R_f) - \sigma_p \left( \frac{R_m - R_f}{\sigma_m} \right)$$
- **Rp:** Portfolio return
- **Rf:** Risk free return
- **Rp​−Rf​**: This term represents the excess return of the portfolio over the risk-free rate.
- **σp:** portfolio standard deviation
- **(Rm - Rf / σm):** This is the [[Sharpe Ratio]]
- **Rm​:** return of the market portfolio 
- **σm:** standard deviation of the market's return
