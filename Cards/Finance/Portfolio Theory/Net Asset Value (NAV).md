# NAV
- A way to value funds and other vehicles that aren't exchange traded
- **Underlying shares:** shares of the equities within the fund
- **Fund shares:** shares of the fund itself
- **NAV:** The value of each *fund share*
$$\text{NAV} = \frac{\text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities}}{\text{Number of Shares}} $$
- **Investor Return**
$$ \text{Return for investor} = \frac{\text{NAV at end of year} \times (1+r) - \text{NAV at beginning of the year} + \text{dividends paid}}{\text{NAV at beginning of the year}} $$
- This formula gives a *rate of return* for investors in the fund
- Front load and back end charges excluded, as they are *investor liabilities*
