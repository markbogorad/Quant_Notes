# Market Efficiency
## Efficient Market Hypothesis
- The markets reflect all publicly available information *instantaneously*
- Positive alpha (profit) is possible but attributed to luck or above average risk
- Only holds true if costs of obtaining information are 0
	- Information seekers are incentivized by money, will provide information until it is no longer profitable information
- Under this scenario, all active management is a waste of time and the best strategy is to hold diversified ETFs
	- Others theorize that *it is* active management that makes markets efficient, as individuals look to exploit arbitrage opportunities
## Weak Form Efficiency
- **Theory:** historical prices and trading volumes are reflected in prices
	- Means these can't be used to predict subsequent returns
## Semi Strong Form Efficiency
- **Theory:** prices reflect *all publicly available info*
## Strong Form Efficiency
- **Theory:** prices reflect all public and *insider info*
## Graphically:
![[Pasted image 20240429175305.png]]
- Strong form implies weak form (if all info is priced in, historical is also priced in)
- Weak does not imply strong (if historical info is priced in, insider is not necessarily priced in)
## Market Efficiency Tests
### Seasonality
- If markets are efficient, we should not observe seasonal patterns
	- Otherwise, investors will take advantage of these arbitrage opportunities (buy December sell January)
- In practice we have a **January Effect** in small cap stocks
	- A theory is people do this to realize losses and gain tax advantages
### Predicting from Past Returns
- Authors were essentially looking for positive [[Serial Correlation]]
- Findings:
	- Weak serial correlation on short time frame
	- Momentum property: winners stay winners and losers stay losers
		- Found in 3-12 month returns
	- Negative serial correlation (reversal property) found over a 5 year period
### Predicting from Unique Characteristics
- Small caps vs large caps
	- Small caps earn more but are more risky
- High book to value (**value firms**) vs low book to value (**growth firms)**
	- High book value earn more
### Speed Tests
- Testing how quickly information is reflected in stock prices
- Done via event studies: testing for speed around information announcements (earnings reports)
- **Results:** post earnings announcement drift found
	- Slow speed of information adaptation
	- Prices continued to drift after earnings, a potential sign of **information leakage**  [[Corporate Finance MOC]]
