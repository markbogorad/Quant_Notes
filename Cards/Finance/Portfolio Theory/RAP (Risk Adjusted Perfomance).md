# RAP
- Really a generalized term for any risk metric, but in class this was a unique one
- Captures fund performance relative to market
$$ \text{RAP} = \frac{\sigma_{\text{MKT}}}{\sigma_{\text{FUND}}} \times \text{FUNDRET} + \left(1 - \frac{\sigma_{\text{MKT}}}{\sigma_{\text{FUND}}}\right) \times \text{risk-free} $$
- Emphasizes the fund return more if the fund is steadier than the market and emphasizes the risk-free return more if the fund is riskier.
