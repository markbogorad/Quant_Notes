# Sovereign Wealth Funds
- Country level investment vehicles
- Main source of income: commodity export surpluses
- Source of profit is denominated in FX, may cause destabilization [[FX MOC]]
- Passive management strategy (longer term mindset)
## Politics
- Typically invest very quietly: some investments may cause political fallouts
- Typically no active management of companies they invest in
	- If sovereign wealth funds try and push a company to make certain changes, it will seem like the country is itself trying to make political changes
