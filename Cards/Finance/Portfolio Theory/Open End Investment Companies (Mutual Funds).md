- **Open End:** Shares get added to existing stock (or deleted when selling)
	- Essentially works like a balloon
	- Shares Created = (Money Invested / [[Net Asset Value (NAV)]])
- Selling shares
	- Seller gets a price equal to NAV for each share
	- The fund would need to sell an equal amount of underlying assets to match this NAV
- Trading
	- Not exchange traded --> need to go directly to fund
	- Price typically close to NAV
