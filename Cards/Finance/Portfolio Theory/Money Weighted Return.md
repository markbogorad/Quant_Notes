# Money Weighted Returns
- Take into account cash inflows and outflows (unlike [[Time Weighted Return]])
- Same concept as the IRR formula [[Corporate Finance MOC]]
$$ {NPV} = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \frac{CF_t}{(1 + r)^t} = 0 $$
- NPV is the sum of all discounted cash flows
	- Equal to 0 because we are looking for the spot where the investment is exactly offset by the cashflows [[Corporate Finance MOC]]
