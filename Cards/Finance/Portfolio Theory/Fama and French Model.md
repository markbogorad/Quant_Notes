# Fama & French 3-Factor Model
$$ E(R_{i}) - R_{f} = \alpha_i + \beta_i(E(R_{m}) - R_{f}) + s_iE(SMB) + h_iE(HML) $$
- Essentially [[CAPM]] with extra members
	- CAPM + SMB factor + HML factor
		- **SMB:** Small minus big; company size premium
		- **HML:** High minus low; company value (equity) premium
			- Value stocks are shown to be more exposed to market downturns (suffer from *excess capacity* making it harder to scale back operations)
			- Also have lower betas during upturns (overall less attractive)
		- Intention here is to use extra factors to proxy risks not captured by CAPM
