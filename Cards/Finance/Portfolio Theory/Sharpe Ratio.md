# Sharpe Ratio
- Can be thought of as a return on risk capital measure
- Essentially a simple risk-reward ratio
	- Numerator is reward (returns)
	- Denominator is risk (standard deviation)
$${Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}$$
- **Rp**​: portfolio return
- **Rf**​: risk-free rate
- **σp**​: standard deviation of the portfolio's excess return
- Arithmetic average returns - risk free rate / std of fund return
## Dollarized Sharpe
- Preferred for under or over capitalized investments
- All components directly in dollar amounts:
$$\text{Dollarized Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{\text{Expected profitability} - \text{Interest costs}}{\text{Risk measure}}
$$
- In [[General Valuation Equation (GVE)]] context, it can be interpreted as the cost of risk ($k$) given by $\sigma$ dollars

## Leverage
- Invariant to level of **leverage** (assuming debt is risk free and must be paid back)
	- Comes from Modigliani and Miller
	- Ex: CDOs are not pure risk free debt (weird case of debt default)
	
> The Sharpe Ratio of an investment is therefore invariant to the level of risk-free financing, while the expected return and risk of a levered asset both increase when debt increase
