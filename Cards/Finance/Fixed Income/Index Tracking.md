# Index Tracking
- Essentially trying to replicate an index for the bond market (like S&P)
- Difficult -> lot more bonds than stocks
## Cellular Approach
- Split index into groups 
	- Duration group, maturity range, credit rating, market sector, etc
## Optimization Approach
- Also try to maximize yields, duration, convexity, etc, alongside cellular approach
## Tracking Error
- A measure of how close the actual portfolio returns are to the created index
- Several factors can contribute to tracking error in bond portfolios:
	1. **Interest Rate Changes**: Fluctuations in interest rates can affect bond prices and yields differently, leading to deviations from the benchmark.
	2. [[Credit Risk]]: Differences in credit quality between the portfolio and the benchmark can result in performance discrepancies.
	3. [[Duration]] Mismatch: Differences in the duration (sensitivity to interest rate changes) between the portfolio and the benchmark can lead to tracking error.
	4. **Liquidity**: Less liquid bonds may not be represented accurately in the portfolio, causing deviations from the index.
	5. **Transaction Costs**: Costs associated with buying and selling bonds can impact the fund's performance relative to the benchmark.
