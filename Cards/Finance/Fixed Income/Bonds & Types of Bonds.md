- **Debentures** are the most basic bond, usually what people refer to
- **Structured bonds** refers to any bond with additional tailor made characteristics (index linked, convertible, callable, putable, etc)
- You are always better off not converting your **convertible bonds**, as your equity share will be the same as your debt share. You basically just forfeited your [[Accrued Interest on a Bond]] and debt priority in capital stack
