# Yield to Maturity (YTM)
   - The total return anticipated on a bond if it is held until it matures. 
   - The YTM is the interest rate (\(r\)) that equates the present value of these future cash flows to the bond's current market price.
   - YTM considers the bond's current market price, par value, coupon interest rate, and time to maturity. 
   - It is often expressed as an annual rate.

$$P = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{C}{(1 + YTM)^t} + \frac{F}{(1 + YTM)^T}$$
   Where:
- \(P\) = Current market price of the bond
- \(C\) = Annual coupon payment
- \(F\) = Face value of the bond (par value)
- \(T\) = Number of years until maturity
- \(YTM\) = Yield to Maturity (the interest rate we are solving for)
