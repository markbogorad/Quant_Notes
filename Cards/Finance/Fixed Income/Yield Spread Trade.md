# Yield Spread Trade
- Concept: trading in anticipation of a [[Non-Parallel Shifts in the Yield Curve]]
- Hedged for parallel shifts (long and short will offset each other)
- Construct a long/short portfolio 
	- Long in a bond you believe will appreciate more (or depreciate less)
	- Short in a bond you believe will appreciate less (or depreciate more) -> works as a hedge
	- **Steepening:** Yield spread will increase
		- long the long-term bonds, short the short-term bonds
		- Lose money on flattening (same as you would profit if successful)
	- **Flattening:** Yield spread will decrease
		- short the long term bond, long the short-term bonds
		-  Lose money on steepening (same as you would profit if successful)
## Optimal Weighting in Yield Spread Trade
- Need to make sure [[Price Value of a Basis Point]] is equal for long and short positions
- $Q_2 = -\frac{V_1}{V_2} \times Q_1$
	- $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are the values of the positions (here 1 is long 2 is short)
	- V is the [[Price Value of a Basis Point]]
	- Negative in this case because it represents the short position on $V_2$
