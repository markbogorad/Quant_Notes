# Yield Curve
- [[Yield to Maturity]] on Y axis and time to maturity on X axis
	- Derived from either [[Coupon Stripping]] or [[Bootstrapping]]
- ![[normal-yield-curve_0.jpg]]

- Yield curve may still have positive slope even if investors expect decreasing rates
	- term premium of longer term bonds -> longer term rates usually higher to induce investment
- A normal yield curve is upward sloping, reflecting maturity and liquidity premium
	- Pure expectations theory
		- Investors expect higher rates over the long run vs short run
	- Market segmentation theory
		- Investors are determined to remain within their segments of the yield curve with regards to maturity
		- An investor in the short term will ask for a premium to move to the longer maturity
	- Liquidity theory
		- Longer term bonds are less liquid than short term bonds â†’ high liquidity = higher yield
## Unusual Yield Curves
- Inverted (negative slope)
	- When short term interest rates become higher than long term interest rates (a capital flight to safety)
		- This is typically before recession
- Flat yield curve
	- When short term and long term rates are similar
		- Transitional phase of the economy
	- No maturity premium here and shifts are parallel


# Yield Spread
- Difference between yield curve of a risk free bond and the bond you are evaluating
- Commonly, this is the difference between the U.S. 10 year and similar maturity corporate bonds
