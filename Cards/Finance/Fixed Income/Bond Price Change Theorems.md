# Price Change Theorems

**1: Change in Maturity Theory**
- Discount or conversely, premium, will converge to par value
	- There are less coupons to be paid out and less potential deviation in returns 
- *Mathematically:*
	- Discount bond:
		- As the periods become less, you are dividing by lower amounts, therefore PV increases
	- Premium bond is the direct opposite

**2: Price Volatility and Coupon**
- Bond price is inversely correlated to [[Coupon Income]] and it's rate
	- The higher the coupon, the lower the volatility (less money left on the table) and vice versa

**3: Volatility and Maturity**
- The longer the maturity, the higher the volatility
	- More money left on table

**4: Volatility and Yield**
- The lower the yield, the greater the volatility
	- Leaving payments for later -> subject to risk
