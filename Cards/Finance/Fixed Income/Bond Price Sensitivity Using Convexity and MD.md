# Bond Price Sensitivity with Convexity & Modified Duration
$$\frac{\Delta P}{P} \approx -MD (y_1 - y_0) + \frac{1}{2} C (y_1 - y_0)^2$$
- P is the price
- MD is the modified duration [[Duration Model]]
- $y_1-y_0$ is the change in basis points we are observing (for sensitivity analysis)
- C is [[Convexity]]
