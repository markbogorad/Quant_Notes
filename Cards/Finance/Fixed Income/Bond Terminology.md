# Bond Terminology
## Clean Price
   - The price of a bond excluding any accrued interest. [[Accrued Interest on a Bond]]
   - It represents the bond's value based on its coupon payments and maturity value, *without considering interest that has accumulated* since the last coupon payment.

## Dirty Price
   - The price of a bond *including accrued interest.* 
   - It is also known as the "full price" or "invoice price" and *represents the total amount the buyer pays*. 
   - The dirty price can be calculated as:
	   - $\text{Dirty Price} = \text{Clean Price} + \text{Accrued Interest}$
    
## Bid/Ask Price
   - **Bid Price**: The price a buyer is willing to pay for a bond.
   - **Ask Price (or Offer Price)**: The price a seller is willing to accept for a bond. 
   - The ask price is usually higher than the bid price.

## Bid/Ask Spread
   - The difference between the bid price and the ask price. It represents the transaction cost and the dealer's profit margin. A smaller spread indicates higher liquidity, while a larger spread indicates lower liquidity. 
   - The bid/ask spread can be calculated as:
	   - $\text{Bid/Ask Spread} = \text{Ask Price} - \text{Bid Price}$
### Example of Bond Pricing Components
- **Clean Price**: $980
- **Accrued Interest**: $20
- **Dirty Price**: $980 + $20 = $1,000
- **Bid Price**: $975
- **Ask Price**: $985
- **Bid/Ask Spread**: $985 - $975 = $10
