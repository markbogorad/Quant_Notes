# Holding Period Return (HPR)
- Final value of the bond at maturity
	- **Gives you a percentage to weight your investment**
- [[Reinvestment Income]] + [[Coupon Income]] + Face Value - Purchase Price
## If sold at maturity
$$ r = \sqrt[n]{\frac{I}{P_0} + n \frac{C}{P_0} + \frac{F}{P_0}} - 1 $$
- n = length the bond is held (usually number of years)
- I = [[Reinvestment Income]]
- $P_0$ = initial price of bond
- C = [[Coupon Income]]
- F = face value (aka par value)
## If sold before maturity 
$$r = \sqrt[k]{\frac{I(k)}{P_0} + k \frac{C}{P_0} + \frac{P_k}{P_0}} - 1$$
- N is basically swapped with K to represent time until you sold off
