# Economics of Natural Gas
## Key Factors
- Development of technology
	- Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has allowed producers to access unconventional reservoirs (shale formations)
		- Has increased supply in the last 40 years and stabilized prices
- Development of natural gas as a commodity
	- Cash markets --> immediate settlement
	- [[Forward Contracts]] markets
- Demand has been rising
	- Reflects environmental benefits, lower prices, and operating flexibility of generators
- Pipeline expansion
	- Has reduced the locational price disparity between producing places and distant places

## Demand
- Natural gas is widely used (27% of U.S. primary energy needs)
- Long term
	- Driven by economic growth, population growth, technology, and prices of substitutes like coal, [[Electricity]] and [[Crude Oil]]
- Short term
	- Demand is driven by weather, economic activity, and competition from other fuel sources
