# Types of Exchange Rate Regimes
![[Pasted image 20240621222436.png]]
- **Freely floating**
	- USD/GBP
	- Fully market determined therefore subject to fluctuation
	- Failures (bad floating decisions)
		- Iceland 2000s
			- Capital flooded in due to open banking sector in 2000s
			- Rapidly flooded out due to 2008 crisis
			- Currency got destroyed
		- Russia 2014
			- Currency depreciated a lot post an oil crisis
				- An energy trading nation should not have a floating currency
				
- **Floating with potential for intervention**
	- EUR/USD
	- ECB bought the euro with reserves once
	- Market remembered the price where they intervened and buy at that level in anticipation of the ECBs participation
	- Set an illusion of a floor
	
- **Floating with occasional intervention**
	- JPY/USD
	- Japanese government intervenes to keep the Yen from being too strong (buy USD, sell Yen)
		- Trading nation needs currency to not appreciate (makes selling goods harder)
	- Risk of using up reserves and not saving economy
	
- **Managed float: ceiling**
	- CHF/EUR
	- Switzerland had a large capital inflow due to flight to safety post 2008
	- Affected their export power -> set a ceiling on the currency to keep exports going
		- When rate would approach ceiling, they would print and sell Francs
	- Risk of hyperinflation
	
- **Managed float: floor and ceiling**
	- HKD/USD
	- Use reserves to keep currency within a band
	- Good for trading nations
	- Managed floats are best for growth nations

- **Fixed (pegged)**
	- PAB/USD
	- Panama is fully fixed to the dollar 1:1
	
- **Currency union**
	- European Union (Euro)
	- No differing rates, just a mutual currency
	- Not always the best as monetary policy now has to be homogenous across differing EU states (see [[Impossible Trinity]])
	- These are best for trade among the union

## Pros of Floating
- Get [[Monetary Policy]] independence -> tighter grip on your own economy
	- Retain seigniorage (ability to issue money)
	- Retain LOLR ability
- Trade shocks will automatically be reflected in currency, creating the necessary price level
- Avoids speculative attacks (George Soros UK)
## Pros of Pegging
- No inflation
	- Banks can't run the debt ceiling
- Facilitates trade and investment with stability
- Avoids speculative bubbles
- Avoids competitive depreciation among trading nations
### Optimal Conditions for a Pegged Regime
- Small size and openness
	- Fixed would facilitate trade
- Existence of a trading partner & high investment
- Symmetry of shocks
	- Shocks that hit the pegged currency should hit the domestic equally
- Labor mobility
	- If high unemployment can safely move to low unemployment
- Remittances should be small
- Willingness to give up monetary policy
- Level of financial development should be small
	- Countries don't float without high level of investment
