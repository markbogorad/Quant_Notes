# The Impossible Trinity of FX
- Need to pick 2 of the 3:
	- **Pegged regime**
	- **Capital mobility**
		- Investment comes into the country with no restriction
	- **Monetary autonomy**

## Regime Options
- **Option A:** capital mobility and independent monetary policy
	- Ex: USA
	- **Failure:** There will be arbitrage opportunities with a independent monetary policy and free capital inflows (ex: raising rates causing capital inflow). A fixed rate will be strained by capital flows and will ultimately break. Continuous intervention would not work with independent monetary policy 
	
- **Option B:** Pegged rate and capital mobility
	- Ex: Hong Kong
	- Good for trading nations
		- Economic stability from exchange rate peg and capital inflow allowance
	- Will need to accept monetary policy of whoever they peg to
	- **Failure**: unable to control their rates
		- If they decrease rates, capital will flow out of the country and strain the pegged regime
			- Will need to intervene by supplying more home currency (bad)
			
- **Option C:** Pegged rate and independent monetary policy
	- Ex: China
	- Failure: must restrict capital flow or else capital movements will destabilize fixed regime
