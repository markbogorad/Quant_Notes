# The FX Market
- **Decentralized:**
	- No government regulation in the FX market
	- No short selling (no pump and dumps)
		- A short position is just buying the opposite currency of a quote
	- Front running is not illegal
		- A broker executing trades based off seeing client's buys/sells
	- Manipulation impossible due to massive liquidity
	- Market relies on interbank lending
- **Fragmented:**
	- Lots of places where you can buy and sell FX
- **Segmented:**
	- Where you trade is determined by your size
	- Smaller players are relegated to worse platforms
