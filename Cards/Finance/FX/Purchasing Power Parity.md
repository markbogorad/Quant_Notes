# Purchasing Power Parity
- Based on the Law of One Price
	- Price of good i at time t in domestic currency should equal the price of the same good at the same time converted in domestic currency terms
		- $P_t^i = S_t P_t^{i*}$
- Purchasing Power Parity:
$$Q = \frac{SP^*}{P} = 1$$
		- Q is the real exchange rate
		- P is the cost of living
		- SP is cost of living converted into the same currency
- Holds because of no arbitrage:
	- If unequal, money would just flood into lower cost country until equal
	- Not true in practice:

## Absolute PPP
- Incorporates inflation 
$$\sum a^i P_t^i = S_t \sum a^i P_t^{i*}$$
		- Sum of local price levels = sum of foreign price levels in local currency
			- P is inflation rate
- Inflation differentials should equal price depreciation of inflating currency
	- $\Delta s_t = \Delta p_t - \Delta p_t^*$
	- Same theory as [[Uncovered Interest Rate Parity]] but for inflation instead of interest rates
- This holds true only in the long run
