# Carry Trade
- Attempts to exploit the failure of [[Uncovered Interest Rate Parity]]
- **Strategy:**
	- Borrow at a low interest rate currency T-Bill
	- Invest at a high interest rate currency T-Bill
	- Profit is the differential
- Only works if forward rate unbiasedness fails
- Works best during periods of low volatility
	- **Key:** high volatility will cause a massive loss


## Carry Trade Types
**Average Pairwise Carry**
- A portfolio of multiple carry trade pairs
- Diversification
- Average return of 4.6% and a [[Sharpe Ratio]] of 0.42

**HML Carry**
- Matching high interest pairs and low interest pairs in portfolio segments
	- Ex: 6 rates with 1 being smallest and 6 being highest, you would have 3 pairs: (1,2), (3,4), (5,6). 
- If expectations are true -> low interest rate portfolio will make a small loss and high interest rate portfolio will gain more
- Average return of 6.3% and a [[Sharpe Ratio]] of 0.63

**Timing Indicators**
- Used by Deustche Bank
- Essentially set up an "on and off" button for the carry trade based on technical indicators

**Warning Indicators**
- Used by Citibank
- Same on and off concept just for realized volatility
	- When volatility is low: on, when high: off

**Switching Assets**
- Instead of investing in risk free assets, invest in something of higher yield (say corporate bonds)
