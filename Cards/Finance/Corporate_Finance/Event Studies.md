# Event Studies
- Analysis of whether or not there is a significant reaction in financial markets due to the occurrence of a specific event
- Captured by [[CAPM]] (almost) formula:
	- $\varepsilon_{i,t} = R_{i,t} - (\alpha_i + \beta_i R_{M,t})$
		-  $\varepsilon_{i,t}$ = abnormal return n day t
		- $R_{i,t}$ = actual return on day t
		- $(\alpha_i + \beta_i R_{M,t})$ = expected return on day t
			- alpha and beta come from [[OLS Estimator]] regression (just a [[Multiple Linear Regression]])
- Note: information leakages occur +- 40 days to event such a [[Mergers & Acquisitions]]
