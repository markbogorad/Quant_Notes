# Capital Budgeting
- Decisions on what investments you make
- What to include in pricing:
	- Opportunity cost of using a physical asset
	- Positive and negative side effects to other projects
	- Changing net working capital
	- Taxes
	- Do not include:
		- Interest expenses (double counting since you already discount)
		- Sunk costs
## Valuation Methods
- NPV
	- $\text{NPV} = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t}$
	- Sum of all discounted present values
- IRR
	- $0 = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{C_t}{(1 + \text{IRR})^t}$
		- What is the % when NPV = 0 (minimum rate of return on the project)
- Profitability Index
	- $= \frac{\text{PV of Future Cashflows}}{\text{Initial Investment}}$
	- Ex: if index is 1.1, for every 1 dollar invested you make 10%
- Payback period
	- How long it takes to recoup investment (no discounting)

## Sensitivity and Feasibility Analysis
- Sensitivity analysis
	- Changing 1 variable and seeing what happens
- Feasibility -> how likely is a variable to be unstable
