# Bond Yields
-  **Current Yield**:
   - The annual coupon payment divided by the current market price of the bond. 
   - It provides a snapshot of the income return on a bond but *does not account for capital gains or losses.*
   -  $\text{Current Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Coupon Payment}}{\text{Current Market Price}}$

-  **Yield to Call (YTC)**:
   - The yield of a bond assuming it will be *called* (redeemed by the issuer) *before its maturity date.* 
   - It accounts for the bond's current market price, the coupon payments, the call price, and the time until the call date.

- **Yield to Maturity (YTM)**:
	- [[Yield to Maturity]]

5. **Yield to Worst (YTW)**:
   - The lowest yield an investor can expect if the bond is called, put, or reaches maturity. 
   - It is a conservative measure, ensuring the worst-case scenario yield is considered.

6. **Nominal Yield (Coupon Rate)**:
   - The annual interest rate paid by the bond as a percentage of its face value (par value). It is fixed at issuance and does not change with the market price of the bond.
   -  $\text{Nominal Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Coupon Payment}}{\text{Par Value}}$

6. **Yield Spread**:
   - The difference in yields between two different bonds, often of different credit qualities or maturities. 
   - It is commonly used to compare the yield on a corporate bond to a benchmark, such as a government bond or another corporate bond. 
   - The yield spread indicates the additional risk or return required by investors.
   - Wider yield spread
		- Decreases value of lower grade bonds more than higher grade bonds
		- Investors are less confident that the issuer will continue to make payments
- Narrower credit spread
	- Value of lower grade bonds increases more than higher grade\
	- Bond investors are more confident corporate issuer won't default
