# Impairment
- Mainly used for [[Tangible Non Current Assets]]
- When the carrying amount (NBV) is larger than the amount that will be gained from using or selling the asset (recoverable amount), then itâ€™s not prudent to continue to use NBV
- When NBV < recoverable amount
	- Impairment occurs when the carrying amount is higher than the recoverable amount
	- Carrying amount = depreciated value
	- Recoverable amount = reevaluated price less depreciation
- *Impairment loss = carrying amount - recoverable amount* 
	- Counted as an expense in [[Income Statement]]
		- Credit asset in [[Balance Sheet]]
		- Debit impairment loss in [[Income Statement]]
	- Reversing an impairment loss is counted as income in [[Income Statement]]
		- Ex: acquired goodwill is now worth more
