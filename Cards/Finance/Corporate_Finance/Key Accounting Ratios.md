## Profitability Ratios
These help to identify where large portions are spent (adds up to 100% in the end) and where money is made (ex: low vs high margin business)
- Gross Profit Margin = $\frac{Gross Profit}{Sales Revenue}\times 100$
	- Gross Profit from [[Income Statement]]
- Operating Profit Margin = $\frac{Operating Profit}{Sales Revenue}\times 100$
	- Operating Profit from [[Income Statement]]
- Net Profit Margin = $\frac{Gross Profit}{Sales Revenue}\times 100$
	- Net profit from [[Income Statement]]
	
- ROCE = $\frac{Operating Profit}{Capital Employed}\times 100$
	- Capital employed = equity - non-current liabilities
	- Compares input (capital employed) to output (operating profit)
	- A measurement of the management of the business (how well are funds being used)
	- Below 7% is bad
- ROE = $\frac{Net Profit}{Equity}\times 100$
	- Compares investment by owners to profit returned by their investment
	- Compare the % to any kind of returns (should be above market 7-12%)
	
## Efficiency Ratios
- Efficiency of Working Capital
	- Working Capital = current assets - current liabilities
	- If working capital is 0 it means the business is fully sponsored by suppliers
- Efficiency of Human Capital: *measuring how long it takes to complete certain tasks*
	- Average Inventory Turnover in period = $\frac{\text {Average Inventories}}{\text{Cost of sales}} \times 365$
		- How long it takes to sell inventory (less the better unless intentionally stocking up)
	- Average settlement for trade receivables = $\frac{\text {Average Trade Recievables}}{\text{Credit sales}} \times 365$
		- How long it takes businesses to pay up (shorter the better)
	- Average settlement for trade payables = $\frac{\text {Average Trade Payables}}{\text{Credit Purchases}} \times 365$
		- How long it takes for the business to pay back suppliers (the less the better)
- Net Asset Turnover
	- = $\frac{\text {Sales Revenue}}{\text{Capital Employed}}$
		- Capital employed = equity - non-current liabilities
- Efficiency of Human Capital
	- = $\frac{\text {Sales Revenue}}{\text{Number of Emloyees}}$
	- Sales per employee
	- Higher the better
	
## Liquidity Ratios
- Current Ratio
	- $\frac{Current Assets}{Current Liabilities}$
		- Tests whether assets can cover expenses, should be at least 1:1 ideally 2:1
- Quick Ratio
	- $\frac{\text{Current Assets Excluding Inventory}}{Current Liabilities}$
		- Tests if you have enough liqudiity even if you do not make any sales
- Cash generated from operations to maturing obligations
	- $\frac{\text{Cash Generated From Operations}}{Current Liabilities}$
		- Shows ability to cover obligations on a cashflow basis [[Cash Flow Statement]]
- Operating Cash Cycle (not a ratio but useful figure)
	- It is the funding gap between trade receivables and trade payables (want it low)
	- $\text{Inventory Days}+\text{Trade Recievable Days}+\text{Trade Payable Days}$
		- The bigger the operating cash cycle, the worse is the liquidity position
## Gearing Ratios (Debt)
- Gearing Ratio
	- $\frac{\text{Non Current Liabilities}}{Equity + Non Current Liabilities} \times 100$
		- Measures proportion of NCLs over the long term funding of business
		- Denominator is basically equity
		- Should be at least 1
- Interest Cover Ratio
	- $\frac{\text{Operating Profit}}{Interest Expense}$
		- Measures how many times can interest expenses be covered
			- Larger the ratio, the better

## Investment Ratios
- EPS (earnings per share)
	- $\frac{\text{Earnings Available to Shareholders}}{\text{Ordinary Shares in Issue}}$
		- Sector specific -> compare same business over time or similar businesses (can't do across industry)
- PE (price-earnings ratio)
	- $\frac{\text{Share Price}}{\text{EPS}}$
		- Relationship of how much the business is valued by the market vs how much profit it makes
- Dividend Cover Ratio
	- $\frac{\text{Earnings Available for Dividends}}{\text{Dividend Announced for Next Year}}$
		- Compares profit to dividend payout
