# Execution
- Acquirer and target management meet to discuss a price
	- If agreed, they propose to shareholders, where 50% of shareholders must agree
	
- **Proxy Contest:** trying to get rid of board members who do not approve of a merger by using shareholders to vote them out
- **Free Rider Problem:** Target shareholders have incentive to not sell their shares post merger
	- This is because post merger price is always higher than the offer price -> want to sell at the higher price but it is inconceivable if no one sells
	- **Toehold Solution:** buy a small stake in the company before anyone suspects the merger
	- **Large shareholder solution:** target massive investors that will swing the deal in your favor
## Deal Resistance
- Either because of manager entrenchment (managers do not want to lose status) or shareholders shopping for higher price
