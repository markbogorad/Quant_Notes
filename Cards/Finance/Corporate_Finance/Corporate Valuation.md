## DCF Valuation
- Price now
	- $P_0 = \frac{D_1 + P_1}{1 + r}$
- Price at any period (divided discount model [[Cost of Capital]])
	- $r_e = \frac{D_1}{P_0} + g$
### If Growth is not Constant
- Find period where dividend becomes constant
- Dividends before + constant dividend growth thereafter
- ![[Pasted image 20240614161101.png]]
	- Add the discounted constant growth to that last year of dividends and discount that total as if its year 3
- Numerator -> free cash flow
	- Free cash flow = Operating cash flow - CAPEX - $\Delta$ net working capital
		- Operating cash flow = earnings before tax - marginal tax + depreciation
			- = EBIT (1-t) + depreciation
		- CAPEX = $\Delta$ net fixed assets + depreciation
		- $\Delta$ net working capital = (CAs- CLs this year) - (CAs - CLs last year)
## Multiples Valuation
- AKA market approach
- Based on how similar businesses are valued

- **Equity multiples**
	- **PE ratio** 
		- $\text{Price to earnings (P/E)} = \frac{\text{Price per share}}{\text{Earnings per share (EPS)}}$
		- Around 15-20 is good
		- Gearing can impact PE ratio -> not wise to blindly compare companies
	- **Price to book value**
		- $\text{Price to book (P/B or M/B)} = \frac{\text{Market capitalization}}{\text{Book value of equity}}$
		- Same as ROE * PE ratio
		- Useful for analyzing capital intensive businesses
	- **PEG Ratio**
		- $\text{PEG} = \frac{\text{PE}}{\text{Expected growth in EPS}}$
		- Used to measure growth companies
		
- **Enterprise Value Multiples** 
	- Enterprise value = equity value + debt, interest, stock - cash and equivalents       or      equity +- net debt
	- **EV/EBITDA**
		- $\text{EV / EBITDA} = \frac{\text{Firm value}}{\text{Earnings before interest, tax, deprec, amort}}$
			- Firm value / operating income
			- Measures capital intensity, the lower the multiple the higher the capital intensity
	- **EV/EBIT**
		- $\text{EV / EBIT} = \frac{\text{Firm value}}{\text{Earnings before interest and tax}}$
			- Also affected by capital intensity (lower intensity higher multiple)
	- **EV/Sales**
		- $\text{EV / Sales} = \frac{\text{Firm value}}{\text{Revenues}}$
			- Measures revenues before applying interest
