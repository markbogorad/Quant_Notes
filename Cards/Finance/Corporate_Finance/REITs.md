## Key Fundraising Numbers
- TERP
	- Theoretical ex-rights price, the price after a share issue
	- $$\frac{(\text{New shares} \times \text{price of new shares}) + (\text{old shares} \times \text{price of old shares})}{\text{total amount of shares}}$$
- Nil Paid Value
	- Value to a shareholder who is not yet subscribed to issue
	- $$\text{TERP} - \text{rights (new share) price}$$
- Pro Forma NAV
	- Adjusted NAV post rights issue
	- $$\frac{\text{NAV Post Issue}}{\text{total amount of shares outstanding}}$$
	- $$\text{Pro Forma NAV} = \frac{\text{NAV before rights issue} + (\text{Number of new shares} \times \text{Subscription price of new shares})}{\text{Old shares} + \text{New shares}}$$

## REIT Valuation Models
**Earnings Based Models**
- $\frac{\text{Share Price}}{\text{Forecasted EPS}}$
	- [[Earnings Per Share]]
	- Rationale: derives company earnings
		- Used to compare with similar investments

**Asset Based Models**
- Based on [[Net Asset Value (NAV)]]
- $\frac{\text{Share Price}}{\text{Forecasted NAV per Share}}$
	- Rationale: premium or discount to NAV captures expected growth
	
**Dividend Based Models**
- Dividend Yield measure
- $\frac{\text{Dividend}}{\text{Share Price}} = \text{Dividend Yield}$
	- Rationale: values the income stream
