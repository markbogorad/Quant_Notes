# LBO Valuation
- WACC is not applicable -> no equity financing
## When Valuing to Buyout
- Use multiples:
	- EBITDA * EBITDA/EV
	- Something like earnings * 10
## Capital Cash Flow (CCF)
- Same as adjusted present value [[M&A Valuation]]
- $APV = V_L = V_U + PV(TS)$
	- $V_U$ = unlevered firm (100% equity)
	- $V_L$ = levered firm (100% debt)
	- TS is tax shield
	- Same as Modigliani and Miller proposition with no taxes in [[Capital Structure]]
- 1) Value as if you only use equity financing with forecasted cash flows and [[WACC]]
	- $V_U = \frac{FCF_1}{(1 + r_A)^1} + \frac{FCF_2}{(1 + r_A)^2} + \cdots + \frac{FCF_T}{(1 + r_A)^T}$
- 2) add on the present value of the tax shield of debt
## IRR Method
- $0 = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{C_t}{(1 + \text{IRR})^t}$
	- What is the % when NPV = 0 (minimum rate of return on the project)
