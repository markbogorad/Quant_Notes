# Key Ratios
 - **Net Operating Income**
	 - Shows how well the property makes money
	 - $\text{NOI} = \text{Effective Gross Income (EGI)}-\text{Net OPEX}$
		 - $\text{EGI} =\text{Potential Gross Income (PGI)} - \text{Vacancy and Credit Loss}$
			 - $\text{PGI} = \text{Gross Rental Income} + \text {other income}$

 - **Loan to Value (LTV)**
	 - A lower LTV indicates less risk for lenders since the loan is a smaller portion of the property's value
		 - Typically 40-60%
	 - $\text{Loan to Value ratio (LTV)} = \frac{\text{Mortgage amount}}{\text{Price}}$
	 - $\text{Exit LTV} = \frac{\text{Loan amount at end of period}}{\text{Purchase price}}$
	 
 - **Annual Debt Service**
	 - ADS is the total amount of principal and interest payments that must be made on a loan over the course of a year.
		 - Yearly obligation that the property owner must meet to stay current on their loan
	 - $\text {ADS} = \text{loan value} \times \text{mortgage constant}$      OR        $\text {ADS} = \frac{\text{NOI}} {\text{DSCR}}$ 
	 
 - **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)**
	 - A property's ability to generate enough income to cover its debt payments. 
		 - A DSCR greater than 1 indicates that the property generates more income than needed to cover its debt, making it a safer investment.
	 - $\text{Debt Service Cover Ratio} = \frac{\text{NOI}}{\text{Annual Debt Service}}$
	 
- **OPEX Ratio**
	- Shows what portion of the effective gross income (EGI) is spent on operating expenses. 
	- A lower OPEX Ratio is generally better, as it indicates more income is retained after covering expenses.
	- $\text{Opex Ratio} = \frac{\text{Opex}}{\text{EGI}}$
	
- **Price per floor area**
	- Useful for determining the value and affordability of different properties.
	- $\text{Price per Floor Area} = \frac{\text{Purchase Price}}{\text{Lettable floor area (ft}^2 \text{ or m}^2)}$
	
- **Rent per floor area**
	- Useful for comparing rental yields across different properties or locations
	- $\text{Rent per Floor Area} = \frac{\text{PGI}}{\text{Lettable floor area (ft}^2 \text{ or m}^2)}$
	
- **Expenses per floor area**
	- Helps in comparing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of managing different properties
	- $\text{Expenses per Floor Area} = \frac{\text{Opex}}{\text{Net or Gross floor area}}$
	
- **NOI per floor area**
	- It helps investors assess the profitability of a property relative to its size.
	- $\text{NOI per Floor Area} = \frac{\text{NOI}}{\text{Lettable floor area (ft}^2 \text{ or m}^2)}$
	
- **Breakeven Ratio**
	- Shows the percentage of potential gross income (PGI) needed to cover operating expenses and debt service. 
	- A lower ratio indicates a property can break even with less income, making it less risky.
		- Ex: breakeven ratio of 85% -> OPEX can increase another 15% and the property will still break even (all else equal)
	- $\text{Break Even Ratio} = \frac{\text{Operating expenses} - \text{Reserves for Replacements} + \text{ADS}}{\text{PGI}}$
	
- **Yield Capitalization (Cap Rate) or (Initial Yield)**
	- The cap rate is the rate of return on a real estate investment property based on the income the property is expected to generate. 
	- It's useful for comparing the relative value of different investment properties.
	- $\text{Yield or capitalisation rate (Cap rate)} = \frac{\text{Net operating income}}{\text{Capital Value}}$
	
- **Cash on cash return**
	- It shows how much cash income you receive for each dollar of cash invested, excluding loan financing effects. 
	- $\text{Cash on cash return} = \frac{\text{Before tax cash flow}}{\text{Equity}}$      OR        $\left( \frac{\text{NoI} - \text{ADS}}{(1 - \text{LTV}) \times \text{Price}} \right)$
		- $\text {Before tax cashflow} = \text{NOI} - \text{ADS}$
		- $\text {Equity} = \text{Purchase price} - \text{Loan amount borrowed}$
		
- **Mortgage Constant**
	- It helps investors understand the annual loan payment as a percentage of the total loan and *assess the leverage effect* on their investment returns.
	- $\text{Mortgage Constant} = \frac{\text{Annual debt service}}{\text{Original mortgage balance}}$      OR        $\frac{\text{Interest}}{\frac{\text{Interest}}{FV - 1}}$ where $FV = (1+i)^n$
