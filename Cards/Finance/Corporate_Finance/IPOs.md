## IPO Methods
- **Firm commitment**
	- Issuer sells the entire stock to the underwriting syndicate
	- Syndicate holds responsibility for shares on secondary market
- **Best efforts**
	- Underwriter makes the best possible effort to sell under an agreed upon price
- **Dutch auction**
	- Start at high price and incrementally decrease as more people buy
	- Incentive to buy at higher price because you don't know how many shares will remain
- **Direct offering**
	- Offer shares without investment bank (if you are popular as is)
