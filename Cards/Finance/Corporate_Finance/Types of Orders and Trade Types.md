# Order and Trade Types
## Order Types
- **Market Order**:
    - A market order is an order to buy or sell a security immediately at the best available current price.
    - Market orders are executed quickly but may not always be filled at the exact price expected, especially in volatile markets.
- **Limit Order**:
    - A limit order is an order to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better.
    - A buy limit order can only be executed ***at the limit price or lower,*** and a sell limit order can only be executed at the limit price or higher.
    - This type of order ensures that the trader gets the desired price, but there is no guarantee that the order will be filled.
- **Fill-or-Kill (FOK) Order**:
    - A fill-or-kill order is a type of limit order that must be ***filled immediately in its entirety at the specified price or better***, or else it is canceled.
    - It is used when the trader wants to execute a trade immediately and completely, without partial fills.
- **Stop-Loss Order**:
    - A stop-loss order is an order to sell a security when it reaches a certain price, called the stop price.
    - When the stop price is reached, the stop-loss order becomes a market order and is executed at the next available price.
    - This type of order is used to limit an investor's loss on a position.
## Trade Types
- **Block Trades**:
    - Block trades involve the purchase or sale of a ***large number of securities*** (usually more than 10,000 shares of stock or bonds worth over $200,000).
    - These trades are typically negotiated privately, outside of the open market, to minimize the impact on the stockâ€™s price.
- **Basket Trades**:
    - Basket trades involve ***buying or selling a group of securities simultaneously.***
    - This is often done to achieve a desired portfolio allocation or to quickly invest in or divest from a specific sector or index.
- **Program Trades**:
    - Program trading refers to the use of ***computer algorithms*** to execute a large number of trades simultaneously.
    - These trades are often based on predefined criteria and can be used for index arbitrage, portfolio management, or other strategies.
- **Short Sales**:
    - Short selling involves selling a security that the seller does not own, with the intention of buying it back later at a lower price.
    - This is done in anticipation of a decline in the security's price, allowing the seller to profit from the price difference.
    - Short selling involves significant risk, including the potential for unlimited losses.
- **Index-Related Trades**:
    - Index-related trades involve ***buying or selling securities based on their inclusion in a stock index.***
    - This can include trades made to replicate the performance of an index (such as through index funds) or to capitalize on changes in index composition (e.g., when a stock is added or removed from an index).
