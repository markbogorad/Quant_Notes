# Distress Restructuring
- **Distress:** when cash and liquid assets are not enough to meet business needs
- **Vulture Investor**: hunts for distressed comapnies to give liquidity at a high rate of return
## Ways to Remedy
- Equity injection
	- Problematic due to **debt overhang problem**
		- Due to [[The Capital Stack]], creditors are first in line to be repaid, so an equity injection by the shareholders goes into their pockets
- New debt financing
- Asset sales
- Cutting costs
- Private workout
	- Renegotiating liabilities withe existing creditors
- Debt forgiveness
- Final resort: bankruptcy
## Valuation
- Multiples don't work well (no good comparables)
- Use APV like in [[M&A Valuation]]
	- $EV = (1 - p_D) \cdot EV(\text{Normal}) + p_D \cdot EV(\text{Bad})$
		- EV = enterprise value
		- Normal = company continues operating
		- Bad = liqudiation
		- $p_D$ probability of default
