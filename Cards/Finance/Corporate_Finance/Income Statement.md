# Income Statement
- Looks at the financial performance of a business
- Essentially a P/L account

## How it Looks
- **Sales Revenue**
	-  = cash sales + credit sales +- $\Delta$ trade receivables
- (-) Cost of goods sold (CoGS)
	- Opening inventory + purchases - closing inventory
- **= Gross Profit**

- (-) Operating Expenses (OPEX)
	- Salaries, rent, ***depreciation*** (after disposals and acquisitions), insurance, vehicle expenses, etcâ€¦
	- Bad debts written off
	- Allowance for trade receivables
		- Different than the allowance from [[Balance Sheet]]
			- $\Delta$ trade receivables expense from year to year
- (+) Operating Income
	- Allowance for trade receivables written back
		- This is extra allowance from the year before (like an unused precautionary buffer)
- **= Operating Profit**

- (+) Non-operating profit
	- Interest income
	- Profit on disposal
- (-) Non-operating income
	- Interest paid out on borrowings
	- Loss on disposal
- **= Net Profit** = Retained earnings from [[Balance Sheet]]
