# Statement of Cash Flows
- Looks at cash movements: helps measure the lifeblood of the business
- Profit = cash in - cash out (in contrast to the [[Income Statement]])
	- Revenue $\neq$ Cash in
		- Credit sales have no immediate impact
	- Expenses $\neq$ Cash out
		- Credits have yet to be paid
## Preparing the Statement of Cash Flows
- Operating profit is adjusted for non-cash items (aka indirect method)
	- VS direct method being simply cash in - cash out
