# Shadow Banks
- [[Securitization]] based credit intermediation done by non-banks
	- The functions of credit, maturity, and liquidity transformation are performed through daisy chains of various intermediariesâ€™ balance sheets as opposed to a single balance sheet in the case of banks
## How it works
- The original credit intermediation done by banks is broken down into a chain of entities which specialize in each part of the process
- Operate through offshore companies
	- Hide risk with low transparency
- Not subject to regulatory oversight due to non bank status
- Funded by short term notes bought on money markets
#### Pros
- Extra source of funding for the economy
- Shadow banking can complement other long term funding sources for the real economy (provide more loans for economy)
	- Particularly good for SME (small-medium enterprises)
	- Can contribute to the economic recovery
#### Cons
- Can become a dangerous source of systematic risk when shadow banks preform bank like functions
- The channels can become sources of systemic risk when structured to perform bank like functions (maturity transformation and leverage) and when their interconnectedness with banks is strong
	- Need to monitor the channels

## Uses the Originate to Distribute Model
- Loans originated with the purpose to be securities and traded away
	- Banks create loans to be transferred to shadow banks
		- Interlinkage can be very dangerous to financial system
- As opposed to the original banking: **originate to hold model**
	- Retain the loans you create
