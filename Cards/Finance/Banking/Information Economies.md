## Common Banking Asymmetries
- Quick definitions: 
- **Adverse Selection**
	- Type of information asymmetry that causes 1 party to turn on the other
	- Pre-agreement issue
- **Moral Hazard**
	- Risk of a party entering an agreement not in good faith
	- Post-agreement issue
### Banks have more information than borrowers
- Due to their large scale and infrastructure systems, they can better tell if the deal is good when against the average client
#### Market for Lemons:
- Main adverse selection issue in banking
- Adverse selection causing the collapse of the banking market (**no meeting of buyers and sellers**)
- Borrowers anticipate the bank ripping them off
	- Don't participate in the market unless they get really good rates
- Banks believe only bad (desperate) borrowers are left around, since all the smart people are fighting for better rates
	- Can't distinguish between good and bad borrowers
	- Raise interest rates (**root of the adverse selection break down**) because they are not willing to lend at lower rates in wake of the borrowers skepticism of their higher info
##### Mitigating the Market for Lemons Issue
- Improving information by screening borrowers
- Sharing risk of project via loan contract specifications
- Seller/lender invests their own capital into guarantee
- Require a warranty/guarantee to signal the quality of the project (giving collateral to bank)
#### Adverse Selection in Loan Pricing
- As interest rate increase, the quality of the borrower decreases
	- Only desperate people will pay for the loan like this
		- Even non-desperate borrowers are inherently at higher risk of default due to higher cost passed onto them
- Can cause **credit rationing**
	- Banks may impose a limit on the interest rate to ensure a high credit quality
### Moral Hazard Issues
#### Borrower going rogue
- Comes about due to misleading information regarding credit capacity, liabilities, assets, etc..
- Better informed party (borrower) will take actions against the less informed part
	- Borrower is better informed because inly he knows his true credit standing
	- Borrower can finance riskier projects that initially agreed upon
##### Mitigating Moral Hazard
- Monitoring borrowers
- Imposing covenants
	- Strict rules regarding the loan, that if violates allows the bank to change interest rates or other loan conditions
#### Banks too big to fail
- When banks can rely on the government during times of trouble, they may have incentive to take increase risk taking
- Profits stay with them if they win, losses go on the government (taxpayer) if they lose
- Unfair: the riskier you are, the more likely you will be saved
