# Capital & Liquidity
**Capital**
- Type of liability (equity)
- Way of funding the bank
- Refers to value of shares held by the shareholders
- Considered a permanent source of funds in contrast to short and long term debts
- Banks don't actually “hold capital” like a vault → it is just shares
- More capital = more funding for lending
    - Misconception: more capital means less lending (not true)

**Liquidity**
- Asset side concept (cash)
- Assets that are easily transferable to cash
    - Cash, bonds, central bank reserves, deposits held in other financial institutions
- Forcing banks to be more liquid (hold more liquid assets) does not directly reduce lending

*Improvements in solvency (more capital) brings improvement in liquidity*
    - Higher CET1 = more available stable funding (NSFR) & capital increases while RWAs don't change (better capital ratios)
    
*Improvements in liquidity bring improvements in solvency*
    - Substituting mortgage loans with liquid securities can improve solvency since RWA decrease
    - Improving liquidity is basically shortening the maturity mismatch
