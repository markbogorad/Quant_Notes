# Credit Multiplier
- Aka money multiplier
-  Explains how an initial deposit can lead to a greater increase in the money supply
	- Root of the **fractional reserve banking system**
	$$ Credit Multiplier = \frac{\Delta Deposits}{\Delta Reserves} $$
	OR
	$$ Credit Multiplier = \frac{1}{Requires Reserve Ratio} $$

- A fraction of bank deposits are required to be kept as reserves to allow for withdrawals, this is the **Required Reserve Ratio**
	- The lower the reserve requirement, the more money is created
		- Controlled by central bank
### How the cycle works:
- Deposits go into bank
- Bank holds RRR % of the reserves, lends out the rest via loans
- Money lent out via loans eventually returns back into the banking system via deposits when borrowers spend their money
- These deposits are used to make subsequent loans, once again taking out the RRR out of the total deposit sum
- Cycle keeps repeating

## What the credit multiplier is
- Say RRR is 10%
- That means 1/0.10 = credit multiplier of 10
	- *A credit multiplier of 10 means that for every 1 dollar deposited, the consecutive lending sequence of fractional reserve banking will create 10 dollars*
