- Measured with [[Value at Risk (VaR)]]

## Trading Book

- Trading book securities have more strict restrictions -> potential for [[Regulatory Arbitrage]] if banks falsely move from trading to banking book
	- Rules for trading book:
		- Security must be for 
			- short term resale
			- profit off short term movements
			- locking in arbitrage profits
			- hedging risks from the above
	- Switching in and out of trading book is heavily regulated
