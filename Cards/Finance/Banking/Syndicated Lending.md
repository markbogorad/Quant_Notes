# Syndicated Lending
- International [[Wholesale Banks]] (Investment Banking) activity as well as commercial
- When a lead bank convinces a group of other banks to form *one large loan*
	- Loans are typically to very large firms and governments
		- Smallest loans are 50M usd
- Loans are used to finance large projects
	- Ex: building a bridge
- Interest rates are typically at slight margin above *LIBOR*
	- Good borrower → 0.5% interest over LIBOR
	- Bad → 3% interest over LIBOR
- Syndicate loans are **tradable**
## Pros for Borrower
- Cheaper than bond issuance
- Can achieve lower spreads via syndicate vs arranging loans with individual banks
- Flexible funding structure in different currencies
- Can be closed quickly
- More stable source of funds than bonds
- Bypass the regulatory *large exposure limit* that comes with alternative markets
### Cons
- Banks have incentive to make lower quality loans (think asset backed securities)
- Give loans to banks with high debt ratios
	- Brought a decline in loan syndication
- Hard to ascertain quality of assets
## Structure
- Lead bank gets approached by borrower
	- Operates on behalf of all other syndicate banks
	- All syndicates have a separate claim on borrower
## Process
**Before**
- Issuer (borrower) will typically solicit bids from a number of banks.
- The banks will outline their proposed terms and syndication strategy.
- After bidding phase, issuer's sales desk will solicit informal feedback from investors on what their appetite for the deal will be and at what price they would be willing to invest.
	- Gauge sentiment from institutional investors and colleagues in other FIs
- After bid, borrower asks banks to show their terms in a roadshow
	- Select 1 bank after (award mandate to lead arranger)

**During**
- Once the mandate is awarded the arranger will prepare an information memorandum ("IM"), describing the terms of the transaction.
- The IM is subsequently distributed to prospective lenders.
- 3 main phases:
	- Underwriting
		- Sponsor and borrower agree on deal, done by best effort or club deal [[Corporate Finance MOC]]
	- Sub-underwriting
		- Other lenders are brought in
	- General Syndication
		- Transaction is opened up to open market (other banks and institutional investors)

**After**
- Once the sell-down process has closed, the final terms are then documented in detailed credit and security agreements.
- Once the loan has allocated the loan becomes "free to trade" in the secondary market.

## Syndicated Loan Ex:
![[Pasted image 20240515102659.png]]
- Fees for banks to profit off:
	- Arranger fee → upfront fee for arrangement team for putting the deal together
	- Participation fee → for other participants for agreeing to join the facility
	- Underwriting fee → for underwriter for guaranteeing availability of funds
	- Commitment fee → for syndicate to compensate for the cost of regulatory capital set aside for transaction
	- Utilization fee → prior agreement that if above a certain threshold is drawn, there needs to be extra payment
		- Ex: if above 50% is drawn, + 5 basis points above libor
	- Agency fees → payable annually to cover cost of administering the loan
	- Book runner fees

## Types of Syndication
### Fully Underwritten
- The mandated lead arranger **guarantees the borrower the full amount of money**
- If they can’t raise enough money through the syndicate, they will personally lend the outstanding amount
- This type of loan is priced higher by bank
- Most common in European market
### Best Effort
- Syndicate **does their best to raise amount agreed**
	- If they don't raise enough, they will give as much as they have raised
- Cheaper than fully underwritten option
- Borrower runs risk of not having enough funds
- Most common in U.S. market
### Club Deal
- Not allowed to trade out of the loan
- Original syndicate remains throughout whole project

## Types of Actual Loans
- **Term Loans**
	- Loan specified for a specific period
- **Amortizing Term Loan**
	- Short term
	- Progressive repayment schedule (payments increase over time)
- **Institutional Term Loan**
	- Longer maturity and bullet repayment (repaid all at once)
	- Borrower can repay whenever comfortable
