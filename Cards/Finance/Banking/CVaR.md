# Credit Value at Risk
- Change in value of an asset due to credit risk
	- Market risk methodology for credit risk ([[Value at Risk (VaR)]])
		- Can cause drops even if there is no default (happened during EU sovereign debt crisis)
$$CVaR = \text {Loan Value} \cdot z_{\alpha} \cdot \sigma$$
- Loan value derived from credit ratings
- Uses [[Monte-Carlo Simulation]] for actual calculation, typically 95% confidence
- N is typically 1 year: “If the next year is a bad year, how much will I lose on my loan portfolio”
