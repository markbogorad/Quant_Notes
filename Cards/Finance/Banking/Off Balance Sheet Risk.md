## Off Balance Sheet Activity
### Types of OBS activity
 - Loan commitments
	 - Receive a loan at a predetermined rate and maturity. FIs get paid a fee for these, profitable as long as they aren't exercised
	 - Carry [[Interest Rate Risk]] if cost of funds become more expensive in future
	 - Takedown risk (future [[Liquidity Risk]])
	 - Aggregate funding risk: higher liquidity cost due to freezing of interbank market
 - Financial guarantees 
	 - [[Letters of Credit (LOC)]]
	 - Bank makes commitment to pay 3rd party in the case that a borrower will default
		 - Enhances another borrowers credit standing
		 - Still have credit risk (buyer of guarantee wont deliver)
 - Credit default swaps [[Derivatives MOC]]
	 - Contingent [[Credit Risk]] -> counterparty defaults (ex: AIG 2009)
 - Loans sold without securitization
	 - With recourse -> full credit risk
