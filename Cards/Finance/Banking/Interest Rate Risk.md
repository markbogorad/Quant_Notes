# Interest Rate Risk
- Risk that unexpected changes in the interest rates will affect bank performance or earnings
- Comes from the maturity mismatching between assets and liabilities ([[Asset Transformation Function]])
	- **Fixed rate assets** (deposits) VS **floating rate liabilities** (loans)
- Measured by [[Duration Model]]
- Highly correlated with [[Monetary Policy]] (central bank interest rates)
## Main rates:
- **Cost of funding:** rate paid on deposits (savings account interest for example)
- **Interest Income:** rate charged on loans
## Types of interest rate risk
- **Refinancing risk**
	- Cost of borrowing increases
	- Happens when maturity of liabilities < maturity of assets
		- Liabilities will be exposed to a change in interest rate when it comes time to get new ones
	- Banks are inherently prone to this, as their balance sheet is like this by default
	- Particularly concerning when **deposit interest rate increases**
- **Reinvestment risk**
	- When interest income falls below cost of borrowing
	- When maturity of assets < maturity of liabilities
		- Will need to go hunt for new assets, at potentially lower returns

## In Bonds
- If interest rates rise → bond price will fall → capital loss will be realized
- If interest rates fall → bond price will rise → there will be capital gain

- ○      Reinvestment risk

■      Risk of reinvested cash flows falling (coupon income reinvestment ie interest-on-interest)

■      Higher maturity → higher reinvestment risk

■      Higher coupon → higher reinvestment risk

■      Reinvestment risk and interest rate risk have offsetting effects
