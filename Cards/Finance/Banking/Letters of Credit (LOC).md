# Letter of Credit
- Essentially a guarantee that the bank will reimburse *the exporter (seller)*
	- Step 2 of [[Trade Finance]] diagram
- The bank takes on the full [[Credit Risk]] of the transaction
- LOCs can be revokable 
## Process:
1. Buyer and seller agree terms, including means of transport, period of credit offered, latest date of shipment and other relevant terms to be used.
2. Then the buyer applies to the bank for a letter of credit to be issued.
3. The bank evaluates the buyer’s credit rating, and may require a cash cover and/or a reduction of other lending limits.
4. The issuing bank will issue a letter of credit. This will be sent to the advising bank by airmail, telex or SWIFT.
5. The advising bank will establish authenticity of the letter of credit using signature books or test codes, then informs the seller (beneficiary).
6. The advising bank may confirm the letter of credit, i.e., add its own payment undertaking.
7. The seller should check that the letter of credit matches the commercial agreement, and that the terms and conditions can be satisfied in good time.
8. If there is anything that may cause a problem, an amendment should be requested.
9. The seller ships the goods and gathers together all the documents asked for in the letter of credit, such as the invoice and transport document.
10. Before presenting the documents to the bank, the seller should check them for discrepancies against the letter of credit, and correct the documents where necessary.
11. The documents are presented to a bank, often the advising bank.
12. The advising bank checks the documents against the letter of credit. If the documents are compliant, the bank pays the seller and forwards the documents to the issuing bank.
13. The issuing bank will also check the documents. If they are in order the issuing bank will reimburse the seller’s bank immediately.
14. The issuing bank debits the buyer and releases the documents (including transport document), so that the buyer can claim the goods from the carrier.
