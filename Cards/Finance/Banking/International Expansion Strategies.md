# Strategies for Expanding Abroad
- **Customer Seeking**
	- Expand overseas to get more customers or follow established clients as seen in trade barriers [[Theories of International Expansion]]
- **Obtaining Foothold**
	- Expand to establish a presence and test the market
- **Follow the Leader**
	- If a large bank invests into a foreign market, smaller institutions will want to do so as well to seem just as competent
	- Herding and free riding 
- **Customer Following**
	- Firms follow their customers abroad (defensive expansion strategy)
	- Have information advantages with their on-going customer relationships
- **Performance and Efficiency Advantages**
	- Increase economies of scale and scope
	- Increase income, returns to shareholders, and share price
- **Managerial Motives**
	- CEOs might be prone to expand with an empire building mindset
	- Can do it for wrong reasons: Increase reputation, leave legacy, take on another job
	- May want to expand to be less prone to hostile takeovers or geographical diversification
## Government motives
- Strong and diverse banking sector can signal the position of the country
	- The larger the banks, the better
- Deregulation of previously over protected banking markets can incentivize expansion
