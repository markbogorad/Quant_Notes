# Delegated Monitoring
- Belief that banks are specialized agents in monitoring the creditworthiness of borrowers (can monitor better than the individual)

- Banks have expertise via providing their own special assessments
	- Process the borrowers information in large volume
- Banks can exploit economies of scale [[Microeconomic Term Index]]
	- I.E. cost reduction due to large scale of operation (lower cost per unit with higher consumption)
	- In practice, banks reduce monitoring costs by increasing the volume 
- Banks can exploit economies of scope
	- I.E. cost advantages due to increasing variety of goods via synergies (production line matching, shared recourses, synergies, etc)
	- In practice, banks have previously collected info stored in a database
### Downside: Delegation Costs
- Someone has to monitor the bank (monitoring the monitor)
- Delegation costs must be lower than costs of monitoring creditworthiness for this to be logical
	- Leads to the principal-agent problem
