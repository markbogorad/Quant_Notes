# Qualitative Credit Models
- Credit scoring by judging characteristics, not numbers
## Borrower-Specific Factor Models:
- **Reputation:** borrower-lending history is important (i.e., relationship lending)
- **Leverage:** the higher the ratio of debt to equity the higher the interest rate and the risk of default
- **Volatility of Earnings:** high volatility increases the probability of default
- **Collateral:** key feature in lending that gives priority on the liquidation of specific assets

## Market-Specific Factor Models:
- **The Business Cycle:** the position of the economy is crucial but also the sector/industry classification of the borrower
- **The Level of Interest Rates:** high interest rates imply restrictive monetary policies. Banks find it more difficult and more expensive to finance their lending and credit risk is higher (as high interest rates make the borrower probability higher)
