# Capital Ratios
- Part of [[Micro-prudential Regulation]]
- Risk Weighted Assets: each asset multiplied by a certain risk factor (0-1)
	- 2 ways to value:
	- Standardized Approach: credit coefficient list created by ratings agencies
	- Internal Ratings based: banks use their own systems

**CET 1 Ratio**
$$ \text{CET1 risk-based capital ratio} = \frac{\text{CET1}}{\text{risk\_weighted\_assets}} \geq 4.5\%  $$
		- CET1 (common equity tier-I capital)
			- Common shares issued by bank
			- Stock surplus (share premium)
			- Retained earnings
			- Other comprehensive income
			- Common shares issued by subsidiaries
		
**Tier 1 Ratio**	
$$ \text{Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio} = \frac{\text{Tier-I-capital}}{\text{risk\_weighted\_assets}} \geq 6\% $$
		- Tier 1 capital
			- Everything in CET 1
			- Callable instruments (after 5 yrs) if replaced with better capital
			- Convertible bonds
			- Stock surplus resulting from callable instruments
			- Minority interest
			- Noncumulative preferred stock
			
**Total Capital Ratio**
$$ \text{Total risk-based capital ratio} = \frac{\text{total\_capital (Tier-I + Tier-II)}}{\text{risk\_weighted\_assets}} \geq 8\% $$
		- Tier 2 capital
			- *Tier-2 capital must be less than or equal to tier-1 capital*
			- Other instruments issued by bank
			- Includes subordinated obligations
			- Long term debt
			- Stock surplus resulting from these instruments
			- Instruments issued by subsidiaries
			- Loan loss provisions
			
**Tier 1 Leverage Ratio**
$$\text{Tier I leverage ratio} = \frac{\text{Tier-I-capital}}{\text{Total Exposure}} \geq 4.5\% $$
		- Total exposure = total assets + all [[Off Balance Sheet Risk]] activities (not risk weighted)
