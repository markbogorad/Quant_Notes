# Micro-prudential regulation
- Checking individual institutions for compliance with [[Banking Regulation]]
- **Rationale:** Consumers are not in a position to judge the safety and soundness of FIs due to imperfect information and agency problems
## Micro Prudential Tools
- Minimum capital requirements for individual institutions
- Capital risk weights
- Capital conservation buffer
- Leverage ratio
- Large exposures limits
- Loan-to-value limits
- Debt-to-income limits
- Liquidity requirements
- Risk management standards
- Licensing standards
## Limitations
- Focus on individual financial institutions
- Measures largely based on accounting data (can be a bit inaccurate)
- Fallacy of composition (what is true for a firm may not be for the whole system)
- Cross-sectional dimension (measuring things at a single point in time)
- Procyclicality (upturns and downturns amplified)
