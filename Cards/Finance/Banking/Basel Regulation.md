# Basel
- Basel Committee: only recommendations, no formal authority

## Basel I (1988)
- Introduced a minimum capital requirement of 8%
	- First focused on credit risk, then incorporated market risk and then operational risk
- Shortcomings
	- Risk classes are constructed in a makeshift way, leaving room for exploitation
	- Penalizes diversification
	- Capital ratios are expressed in book value
## Basel II (2004)
- 3 Pillars
	- Capital Requirements
	- Regulatory supervisory review (stress tests)
	- Increase transparency (market discipline)
- Shortcomings
	- Inadequate capital buffers for economy to be maintained during stress
	- Risk weights were inadequate; not enough and linked to credit ratings (past info
	- No reward for diversification still with new RWAs
	- Distorted incentives: high RWA for loans encouraged securities investment
	- Interest rate & liquidity risk are omitted
	- VaR not enough for market risk

## Basel III (2009)
- Introduction of ratios, RWAs, 
- [[Macro-prudential Regulation]]
