# Securitization
- A form of bank financing that allows lenders to sell of their loans repackaged as securities (**asset backed securities**) to other banks and investors and would use the raised funds to increase lending
- Loans are **originated to distribute** ([[Shadow Banks]])
- **Banks Rationale:**
	- Risk diversification (goes from bank to buyers of ABS) and [[Credit Risk]] reduction via off balance sheet activity (causes [[Off Balance Sheet Risk]])
	- Provides liquidity
	- [[Regulatory Arbitrage]]
	- Profit -> interest income
## Securitization Process
1) Banks originates loans 
2) Bank pools loans with similar characteristics and determined cash flows (should reduce risk in theory)
3) Bank creates an SPV, who's sole purpose is to take responsibility for the pool. Bank sells the pools (ABS) to a created SIV, which keeps the loans until maturity. SIV raises funds for purchase by selling commercial paper (up to 9 months)
4) SIV creates tranches within pool and uses credit enhancements (guarantees, over collateralization, reserve accounts)
6) SPV can sell directly to investors, SIV is just to hold the money
