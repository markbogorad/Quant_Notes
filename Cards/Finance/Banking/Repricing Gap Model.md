# Repricing Gap Model
- Sensitivity to interest rates measure
- Uses accounting (book) values

**How it works**:
- Allocate assets and liabilities to *time maturity brackets* and measure the sensitivity to interest rates of these brackets
- Brackets range from 1 day to over 5 years
## Models:

- **RSA** = Risk sensitive assets (all assets that reprice in the given bracket)
- **RSL** = Risk sensitive liabilities
- **NII** = total assets - total liabilities
- **CGAP Ratio** = CGAP / assets --> over 10% needs to be hedged (5% more or less normal)
## Conclusions

- **Point 1:** Positive repricing gap and **reinvestment risk**
- Point 2: Positive repricing gap, interest income increases more than expenses
- Point 3: Negative repricing gap, expenses decrease more than interest revenue
- **Point 4:** Negative repricing gap and **refinancing risk**
