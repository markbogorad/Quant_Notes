# Forfaiting (aka Factoring)
- A [[Trade Finance]] method that allows exporters to sell ALL of their trade receivables at a discount
- All trade receivables are sold at a discount to the bank without recourse (bank assumes the full [[Credit Risk]] and can't claim anything against seller if buyer doesn't pay)
	- In [[Letters of Credit (LOC)]], the bank can pursue the seller
- Allows the seller to get liquidity fast (cash)
- Original buyer now purchases from the bank directly
	- **Bank essentially bought out the seller position at a discount in exchange for quick liquidity**
## When combined with [[Letters of Credit (LOC)]]
