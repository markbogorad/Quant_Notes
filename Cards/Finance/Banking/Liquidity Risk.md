# Liquidity Risk
- Risk that bank is holding insufficient liquid assets and won't meet liquidity needs without impairment
- Comes from the mismatch in size and maturity of assets and liabilities [[Asset Transformation Function]]
## Types of liquidity risk
- Day to day
- Liquidity crisis
	- When banks have to sell their loans
	- Often leads to [[Insolvency]], but not necessarily a precursor
	- Often banks borrow from the central bank here
## Sources of Liquidity Risk
### Liabilities
- Depositors seek to cash in on their claims or lenders don't renew their credit lines (deposit drains)
- **FIs walk a thin line,** because the higher the liquidity, the more money is not employed under interest via loans, the lower the returns
#### Dealing with Deposit Drains
- Purchased liquidity management 
	- Liability adjustment
	- Buying liquidity from markets (interbank and repo) by selling CDs
	- Works as long as market rates are higher than deposit rates
	- **Risk:** liquidity can dry up (ex: interbank lending market freeze 2009)
- Stored liquidity management
	- Asset adjustment
	- Reducing loan portfolio and putting the proceeds into reserves
### Assets
- Risk of being unable to satisfy *loan commitments* or drops in portfolio value
	- Loan commitment: essentially a forward contract for a loan - receive a loan at a predetermined rate and maturity. FIs get paid a fee for these, profitable as long as they aren't exercised
		- [[Off Balance Sheet Risk]]
	- Key issue: these loans are typically exercised during periods of distress, making things even harder for banks
## Ways to reduce bank runs
- Deposit insurance
	- If bank cant pay, insurance will (250k in US insured by FDIC)
	- Moral hazard: banks are encouraged to take excessive risks
- Lender of last resort
	- [[Central Banks]] discount window facilities
	- Moral hazard: banks want to take excessive risks
- Suspension of convertibility
	- No further withdrawals after a given threshold
	- Impractical: hard to select threshold
- Narrow banking
	- Force banks to invest into assets with short term maturity only
	- Matches liabilities maturity with assets 
	- Kills the [[Asset Transformation Function]]
		- Little value creation
