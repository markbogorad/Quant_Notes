# Credit Risk
- *Risk that a bank borrower or counterparty will fail to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed terms or their creditworthiness will deteriorate*
	- Likelihood of a drop in credit rating
- Expected risk is covered with **loan loss provision**
- Unexpected losses are covered with [[Bank Capital]]
- Credit risk is managed via **diversification**
	- Reduces idiosyncratic (stock specific) risk
	- Still have systematic risk (recessions)
- Credit risk is commonly reflected in corporate bonds via the [[Credit Spread]]
- Stems from the information asymmetry issue in banking ([[Asset Transformation Function]]) with regards to risk
	- Borrower can go rogue
## Origin of Credit Risk
**3 Dimensions:**
1) **Risk:** banks claim against borrowers is riskier than the depositors claim against the bank
2) **Maturity:** assets have longer maturities than liabilities
3) **Liquidity:** Assets have lower liquidity than liabilities
## Bank Loans
- Most common types and their frequency
- C&I -> commercial and industrial
- Most loans are collateralized

## Mitigating Credit Risk
- Screening borrowers
- Collateralize contracts
- Measure risks and establish limits

**Removal Strategies** 
- Loan sales

- [[Derivatives MOC]]: creates [[Off Balance Sheet Risk]] 
## Credit Ratings
- Agencies are in theory unbiased
- Companies have an incentive to shop around for whichever credit agency gives them the best rating
	- Agencies know they are competing for these customers, and might be complaint with each other, irrationally raising credit ratings
