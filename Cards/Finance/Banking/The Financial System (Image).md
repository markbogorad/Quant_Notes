# The Financial System:
![[Pasted image 20240422144616.png]]
## Surplus Units (lenders)
- Agents who have an excess of funds to spend or save
#### Lender Key Requirements:
- Like to hold assets for a **short period** of time and for **highest possible return**
- Like safe assets (minimum risk and costs)
- Like liquid assets 
## Deficit units (borrowers)
- Institutions that are in deficit of funds (need lending)
#### Borrower Key Requirements:
- Want their liabilities to cost less and be of longer maturity 
	- Longer maturity means inherently riskier
- In short: want to pay lowest interest for longest period of time
## Financial Asset
- Claim for a payment of a future sum of money or periodic payment of a future sum of money
## Direct vs Indirect Financing
- Direct: done by financial markets
- Indirect: done by financial intermediary
## Key Reason for Banking
- Mitigating the conflict of interest between lenders and borrowers with regards to their requirements
