	- Quantity of money goes down (investment expenditure down)
- **Loosening of monetary policy**
	- Central bank lowers the interest rate to *stimulate the economy*
	- Lower interest rates â†’ higher investment spending
	- Quantity of money goes up (investment expenditure up) 
	- Increase in GDP and price levels then GDP returns to normal but prices are higher (inflationary gap)
## MP Curve
- Relates the inflation rate to the real interest rate
$$ r = \bar{r} + \lambda\pi$$
	- R bar= exogenous interest rate (real interest rate)
	- Lambda: strength of reaction variable (between 0 & 1)
	- Pi: Inflation rate

- **Taylor Principle**
	- Central banks should adjust their rates by more than the inflation rate to keep up
	- Helps to maintain the purchasing power of money and to stabilize the economy around its long-term growth trend
