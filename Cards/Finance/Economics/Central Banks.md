## Balance Sheet
> See [[Typical Bank Balance Sheet]] for comparison to traditional banking
- Assets
	- Securities via government bonds
	- Liquidity facilities: loans to financial institutions 
- Liabilities
	- Currency in circulation
	- Commercial bank reserves ([[Credit Multiplier]])
		- On the asset side for commercial banks
- Central Bank profit/loss goes toward *national debt*
## Central Bank Tools & Operations
- **Open Market Operations (OMO)**
	- Central bunks buying/selling government securities to manage the amount of money in the system
	- Done via repos, reverse repos, and outright buying/selling
- **Manipulating Interest Rates** [[Monetary Policy]]
	- Decreasing interest rates -> more borrowing -> more money in system
	- Increasing rates -> less borrowing -> less money in system
	- *Fun fact:*
		- Interest rates rising causes bond prices to fall and vice versa
			- People getting similar interest risk free via central bank and flood out of bonds
- **Reserve Requirement Management** ([[Banking Regulation]])
	- Increasing reserve requirements: less money in circulation and higher interest rate
	- Increasing interest on reserves (federal funds rate, see [[Macroeconomic Term Index]])
		- More money given back to banks for lending
- **Discount Rate**
	- Influencing the rate charged on loans in the discount window ([[Macro-prudential Regulation]])
	- Effectively influences the rates of commercial banks (increase in this makes banks increase theirs)
- **[[Quantitative Easing]]**
	- Used when short term rates approach zero
	- Central bank buys long term government securities to increase money supply
- **Forward Guidance**
	- Communicating intended future [[Monetary Policy]] changes
## Central Bank Tactics
- **Inflation Targeting**
	- Central banks practice timing
	- Actual inflation is always slightly higher than promised because central bank has incentive to capitalize on growth
		- After contracts are set, central banks will slightly increase *actual* inflation
		- Results in higher *actual inflation expectations*
## Money Multiplier
- Similar to [[Credit Multiplier]] but for money supply
- Money supply change = (1 / required reserve + currency ratio + excess reserve ratio) * monetary base
	- Currency ratio = Currency in circulation / Deposits
	- Excess reserves ratio = excess reserves / deposits
	- M1 monetary base = deposits + currency in circulation
## Swap Lines
- International currency swaps between banks
	- FED gives dollar amount and receives fx equal amount at todayâ€™s exchange rate
	- Maturity agreed upon in advance (1 week-3 months)
	- Swap back cash at maturity at initial exchange rate
	- FED charges an additional interest rate to swap
- Useful for international banks who face liquidity shortages or dollar shortages
