# Quantity Theory of Money
## Velocity of Money:
$$ V = \frac{P \times Y}{M} $$
- V = velocity of money (average number of times 1$ is spent)
	- Affected by tech innovation and drops during recessions
- P = price level of the economy
- Y = GDP
- M = Quantity of money (one of the M measures in [[Macroeconomic Term Index]])
## Demand for Money
$$ M = \frac{1}{V} \times P \times Y $$
Basically velocity formula rearranged to get M
- M = Quantity of money
- V = velocity of money
- P = price level of the economy
- Y = GDP
## Price Level
$$ P = \frac{M \times V}{Y} $$
- Also same variables (velocity of money rearranged)
## Inflation in this context:
$$ \text{Inflation} = \left( \frac{\Delta M}{M} \right) - \left( \frac{\Delta Y}{Y} \right) $$
