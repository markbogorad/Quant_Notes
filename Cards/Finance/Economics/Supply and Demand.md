# Supply and Demand Dynamics
- **Supply:** Those who have products and are willing to sell
$$ Q^S_x = f(P_x, P_R, W, H) $$
	- P -> Price of good X
	- Pr -> Price of related goods
	- W -> Price of inputs
	- H -> other supply variables
- **Demand:** Those who have seeks to purchase products
$$ Q_{x,t} = f(P_{x,t}, Y_t, P_{rt}, P^{e}_{x,t+i}, T) $$
	- Q -> quantity of good x purchased throughout time t
	- P -> price of good x in period t
	- Y -> incomes in period t
	- Pr -> price of related goods in time t
	- P^e -> expected price of good x in the future (t+i)
	- T -> taste patterns of cosnumers
## Determinants of Supply
- Prices
	- Higher profit margins will increase supply
	- Higher prices will also increase supply
- Input prices
	- As these increase, supply decreases
- Technology
	- Reduces input costs
## Determinant of Demand
- Overall wealth of society
- Prices
- Substitutes and compliments [[Microeconomic Term Index]]
## The S/D Curves![[Supply-and-Demand-12.webp]]
	- Axes are P (price) and Q (quantity)
- Supply curve
	- Shift right
		- Makes you produce more
	- Shift left
		- Makes you produce less
- Demand Curve
	- Shift right (demand shock)
		- Incomes increasing
		- People getting wealthier
		- Substitute prices rise
	- Shift left (negative demand shock)
		- Incomes fall
		- Substitutes get cheaper
		- Bad rep in news (think salmonella or something similar)
