## Aggregate Demand
- Total demand for goods in a market
- Combining the [[GDP & IS Curve]] and MP curve [[Monetary Policy]]
![[Pasted image 20240427131417.png]]
	- X axis is from the IS curve
	- Y axis is from MP curve
- Shifts
	- Left: tightening of monetary policy, decrease in CIGX
	- Right: loosening of monetary policy, increase in CIGX
- Movements along curve
	- Only due to a change in overall price levels
## Aggregate Supply
- The amount the economy can produce
- Positive shocks shift the curve up, negative down

- Short run (SRAS)
	- Driven by inflation expectations, output gap (potential output - real output), and inflation shocks
	- Supply shocks move along the curve
	- Hard GDP changes shift the curve
		- Ex: increase in productivity or decrease in input prices : right shift
- Long run
	- Imposing potential GDP (GDP at full productivity)
	- Driven by cap capital, labor, technology, employment
		- Increase in these = right shift
## Macroeconomic Equilibrium (GDP)
- Intersection is the current value of *real GDP*
- If GDP > equilibrium
	- Expenditure falls short of output (spending too little)
- If GDP < equilibrium
	- Expenditure exceeds output (not enough stuff)
- **Cycle:**
	- Equilibrium will converge to potential output, will become above potential output, and converge back to potential once again
		- Always pressure in the opposite direction
	- Counter clockwise movement

- If below potential output:

- Disinflation
