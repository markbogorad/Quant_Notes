## Monetary Economics
- **Money levels (M):**

		- Sell --> Buy --> Sell
- **Reverse Repo**
	- Selling securities with an agreement to buy it back at a future price
		- Buy --> Sell --> Buy
- **Negative Interest Rates**
	- When nominal inflation rate is below 0 and inflation is below target

- **Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs):**
	- Stable coins: digital currency pegged to national currency
