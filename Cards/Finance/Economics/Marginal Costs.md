# Marginal Costs
- Increase in total costs as a result of producing **1 more unit**
- **Generalized:** increase in total cost / increase in output
- **Average Fixed Costs:** total fixed costs / units produced
	- Continuously decreasing (more units produced cheaper cost)
- **Average Variable Costs:** total variable costs / units produced
	- Continuously decreasing
- **Average Total Cost:** total costs / units produced
## Marginal cost relationships
- If AVC is constant for all levels of output, MC is also constant
- If AVC is rising, AVC must be below MC
- If AVC is falling, MC must be below AVC
- MC cuts AVC at its minimum point

	- Equilibrium: when **marginal costs = marginal revenue**
