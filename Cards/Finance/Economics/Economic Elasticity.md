## Elasticity
- Measures revolve around 1
	- 1 = unit elastic
	- < 1 = inelastic
		- Goods where quantity demanded changes by a smaller % than price
			- Something necessary (insulin)
	- > 1 = elastic
		- Quantity demanded for these good changes by a larger % than price
			- A product with lots of substitutes
			- Fall in price increases total spending, rise in price reduces
	- 0 = perfectly inelastic
		- Quantity demanded does not change as price changes
- **Demand elasticity**
$$ \frac{\%\Delta \text{Quantity Demanded}}{\%\Delta \text{Price}} $$
	- Tells you how much changing price would change revenues
- **Supply elasticity**
$$ \frac{\%\Delta \text{Quantity Supplied}}{\%\Delta \text{Price}} $$
	- How much changing price would cause responsiveness in supply
- **Income elasticity**
$$ \frac{\%\Delta \text{Quantity Demanded}}{\%\Delta \text{Income}} $$
	- Responsiveness of quantity demanded to income changes
	- Negative for inferior goods [[Microeconomic Term Index]]
- Cross elasticity
	- Changes in price of good A after a change in price of good B
	- Substitutes are always **positive cross elasticity**
	- Complements are always **negative cross elasticity**
