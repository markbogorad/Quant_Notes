# Quantitative Easing
- When interest rates are so low you can't lower them without getting negative rates
- A [[Monetary Policy]] tool of [[Central Banks]]
- **How it works:**
	- Central banks expand their own balance sheet, buying government bonds with newly created money
		- This boosts bond prices and lowers long term rates
## Benefits
- Stimulates demand
- Can lower cost of capital for firms
- Gives cash to sellers of bonds → encourages further investment → boosts stock market
- Gives bank more liquidity → encourages lending
- Raises money supply
- Could accelerate demand too much, would need to be reversed quickly
- Impacts on GDP
	- Raises C through higher asset prices
	- Helps I through cost of capital
## Main Channels through which QE affects asset prices:
1) **Macro policy news channel**
	- Announcement of QE purchases gives info to investors on how the MPC will react in the future and state of economy
2) **Portfolio rebalancing channel**
	- QE asset purchases induce investors to rebalance their portfolios and buy new assets, increasing in demand for government bonds
	- Raises bond prices and lowers yields (interest rates)
	- Sellers of bonds use this money to buy new assets, further raising asset prices
	- Occurs both on announcement and over time as investors speculate future policy
1) **Liquidity premium channel**
	- Presence of central bank being involved in the market may improve functioning and reduce the liquidity premium that investors demand
	- Less risk of bonds dropping in the future → less premium
