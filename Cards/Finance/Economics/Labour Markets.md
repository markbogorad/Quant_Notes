# Labour Markets (market for inputs)
- Marginal revenue is now the output per 1 additional person
- Role reversal
	- Demand is coming from firms, supply from individuals
- Marginal costs are costs incurred with employing an additional person
- Valuing investments
	- Not done on the MC=MR basis, use NPV instead
	- **NPV** = (PV of all revenues) - (PV of all costs)
- **Economic rent**
	- Reward earned for being in excess of labour market equilibrium

	- **Rent seeking strategies**
		- Looking for input that gives an advantage that can't be taken away by rivals
## Information Asymmetries
- Employers are uncertain of the *true* skills of their staff
	-  Runs into the principal agent problem -> need to delegate tasks but not certain how well they will be done
- Employees are uncertain of the employers intentions and how they will be treated
## Trade Unions
- Essentially a monopoly over the workforce
	- Would need to employ people through the trade union at *their* prices
- Actually leads to *less* employed people
