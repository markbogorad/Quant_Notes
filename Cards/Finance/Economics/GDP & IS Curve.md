# IS Curve
- *Relates real interest rates to aggregate output*
$$ Y = \left[ C + I - d_f + G + NX - \text{mpc} \times T \right] \times \frac{1}{1 - \text{mpc}} - d + x \times r $$
where
- Y = GDP 
- C: consumption
	- Consumption function = autonomous consumption + MPC * GDP ([[Macroeconomic Term Index]])
- I: investment
- d: parameter controlling the response of investment to changes in rates
- f: financial friction variable
- G: government spending
- NX: Net exports
- mpc: marginal propensity to consume
- T: taces 
- X: change in interest rate
- r: interest rate
- Note: GDP = CIGNX

## Movements in IS curve
- Movement along the curve
	- Interest rate changes: higher rates = movement down the curve
- Shifts in the actual curve
	- Exogenous changes (C, I, G, N, X variables)
	- Increase: right shift, decrease: left shift
