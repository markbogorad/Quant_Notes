# Common Terms
- **Opportunity cost**
	- Loss of gain from obtaining one alternative instead of another
- **Production possibility boundary**
	- Shows all possible combinations of goods when resources are *fully employed*
- **Positive statement**
	- A fact with no value judgement
	- Can be inaccurate fact
- **Normative statement**
	- Opinion based with value judgement → “you should do this”
- **Technical efficiency (productive efficiency)**
	- The production of any level of output at its lowest cost
	- Cant have more of 1 thing without less of another
	- Producing at full capacity
- **Allocative efficiency**
	- Scarce resources being allocated optimally
	- Makes 1 person better off without making another worse off
	- Am I producing the right things?
	- 1 specific point on curve
- **Absolute advantage**
	- Advantage in production when they can make more with same amount of resources
- **Comparative advantage**
	- Advantage in production when countries specialize where there is lower opportunity cost (comparative advantage)
	- Only works with trade
- **Types of economies**
	- Traditional
		- Exchange goods and services for other goods and services
		- Tradition guides economic production
	- Command
		- Centrally planned
	- Free market
		- Capitalist economy
- **Substitutes**
	- If one good is too expensive, people will buy substitutes
- **Complements**
	- If one good is too expensive, there will be no point in buying complements
- **Inferior good**
	- Negative income elasticity
		- Demand decreases as incomes increase
- **Normal good**
	- Demand increases when incomes increase
- **Law of Demand** [[Supply and Demand]]
	- Demand will always slope down
- **Utility**
	- How happy consumers are within a budget constraint
- **Marginal utility curve**
	- Diminishing curve: the more you get of something the less you enjoy it
- **Indifference curve**
	- Combinations that give equal utility
- **Consumers equilibrium**
	- Where utility is maximized:
		- Marginal utility of product x/Price of product x = Marginal utility of product y/Price of product y
- **Zero sum game**
	- Value is not created nor destroyed (winners profit off losers)
- **Negative sum game**
	- Value is destroyed (losses of losers exceed winnings of winners)
- **Paradox of value**
	- Why are diamonds more expensive than water?
		- *Value is determined by marginal utility*
			- Abundance will make something less desirable
- **Capacity**
	- The level of output where short run average costs is at minimum
- **Economies of Scale**
	- Cost reduction due to large scale of operation (lower cost per unit with higher consumption)
- **Economies of Scope**
	- Cost advantages due to increasing variety of goods via synergies (production line matching, shared recourses, synergies, etc)
- **Perfect Competition**
	- Lots of firms in the industry selling the same product (exactly identical)
		- Perfect substitute products
- **Monopoly**
	-  When one corporation owns the entire industry
- **Oligopoly**
	- Collusion among companies to form a monopoly
- **Monopolistic Compeittion**
	- Firms can enter and differentiate but competition is extremely high
		- Something like the London restaurant market
- **Sunk costs**
	- Costs already paid are considered irrelevant in decision making (already lost)
- **Imperfect Information**
	- When no one in the market has full information
- **Asymmetric Information**
	- When one side has more information than the other
- **Information Failure**
	- Individuals are unable to make judgements due to asymmetry
		- Government steps in to force additional info (think food labels)
		- Without this, higher end products get pushed out
- **Market for Lemons**
	- Market collapse due to asymmetric information
	- Seller has more info -> buyer will think he's getting ripped off -> wont buy at a fair price
- **Adverse Selection**
	- Attracting bad customers (ex: higher interest rates attracting bad borrowers)
- **Moral Hazard**
	- Change in party behavior after a transaction (care less about car damages after getting insurance)
		- Banking specific see [[Banking MOC]] and [[Information Economies]]
- **Monopsonist**
	- The sole purchaser of a product
- Externalities
	- When a single person's decision has a wider affect on society
	- Positive externality
		- Welfare increases when this happens (ex: getting a vaccine)
	- Negative externality
		- Welfare would increase if this reduces (pollution)
