# Fiscal Policy
- Decisions related to the planning of *government spending and setting taxes*
- Essentially shifting AD up to stabilize GDP [[Aggregate Supply and Demand]]
	- **Recessionary gap** (below potential)
		- Loosen fiscal policy (decrease taxes and increase spending)
	- **Inflationary gap** (above potential)
		- Tighten fiscal policy (Increase tax decrease spending)
## Fiscal Fine Tuning
- Actions aimed to directly counter demand shocks
	- *Very difficult in practice:*
		- Tax changes can only be made once a year
		- Fiscal policy lags -> ends up causing more destabilization than otherwise
			- **Decision Lag:** takes time to decide what to do
			- **Execution Lag:** takes time to do what is decided
			- **Implementation Lag:** takes time for policy to come in affect
		- By the time everything is in effect, situation may be fully different
