- Volatility is higher for options deeply in the money
	- Market expects significant movement out of these
	- Deep in the money options are subject to less [[Liquidity]] and more [[Supply and Demand]] shocks
	- Traders are willing to keep buying these because they are a form of [[Option Hedging]]
	
- **Important:** [[Black-Scholes]] assumes constant volatility but it is actually not!
- Useful when devising option treading strategies, in particular bets on volatility [[Straddle Trade]], and bets against [[Option Spread Trades]]
