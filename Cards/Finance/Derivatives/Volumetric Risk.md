# Volumetric Risk
- Risk that the volume of your asset being hedged may change unexpectedly (actual supply not trading volume)
	- This would lead to a higher/lower [[Implied Volatility]] therefore a higher/lower [[Vega]]
- Ex: hedge wheat crop with rice, but wheat is destroyed --> now a shortage and price dynamics will change
