# Option Limits and Boundaries

1. An ITM call or put should never be worth less than its intrinsic value (Strike – Underlying for puts, Underlying – Strike for calls).
2. An option can never be worth less than zero.
3. A call spread can never be worth more than the difference between the strikes.
4. A symmetrical fly should never be worth less than zero.
5. A same-strike calendar (expiring into the same underlying) can never be worth less than 0. The further month offers more optionality than the same strike of the closer month.*
6. The put call parity equation should always hold, otherwise it presents an arbitrage opportunity.
