# Marking to Market
- A perpetual money exchange throughout the lifetime of a contract
	- Used in [[Futures Contracts]] and [[Option Intro]]
## How it works:
- You hold a *margin account*
- Need to supply an *initial margin* to open your position
- Money shifts between your margin account and the counterparty's day-to-day
	- If it shifts too much and you lose a certain amount below what is known as a *maintenance margin*, you will get a *margin call*, and will need to top up your margin account
