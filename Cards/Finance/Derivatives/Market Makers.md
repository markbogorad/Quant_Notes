# Market Makers
- How they profit
	- Calculate a theoretical option price [[Option Pricing]]
	- Disseminate (set) the bid slightly below that value and the ask slightly above, proportional sizes for each
	- Edge: the bid/ask spread collected on trades
		- Market makers do not need to be correct on their pricing, and often times they aren't. The consistency of their profits is based off their constant spread
## Akuna Capital Example:
**Example:**Â We buy an option for $1.00. We sell that option out later in the day at $1.04. We do no other trades over the lifetime of that specific option. The option expires worth $0. Therefore, of the 2 transactions, 1 was a winner (the sale at $1.04), while the other was a loser. We lost on 50% of our trades! However, we made $0.04 of profit (1.04 - 1.00) by trading back and forth.
