# [[Put-Call Parity]] Relation to Futures
- A long [[Call Option]] and a short [[Put Option]] position perfectly reconstruct that of a [[Futures Contracts]] long position
	- Reversing (short call and long put) will create a short future
	- Also known as "the synthetic future"

- Therefore, if by no arbitrage a future follows $\frac{k}{(1+r)^t}$, then $C-P$ must equal $\frac{k}{(1+r)^t}$
