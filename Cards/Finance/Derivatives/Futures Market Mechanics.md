# Futures Market Mechanics
- How [[Futures Contracts]] are actually traded
- Done through a clearing house
	- Clearing house serves as the buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer (market maker)
	- Buyers and sellers are anonymous
	- Novated: term for the trade being given from one party to clearing house for clearing house to dish out to the next
		- Literal definition is replacing a contract
- **Clearing**: record keeping and determining what is owed
- **Settlement**: the actual cash exchange
- Profits are [[Marking to Market]] on a daily basis
	- **Variation Margin:** 
		- Daily settlement of gains and losses by 3rd parties with the clearing house via a debit or credit to the 3rd party's margin account
		- Prevents buildup of large debts
		-
