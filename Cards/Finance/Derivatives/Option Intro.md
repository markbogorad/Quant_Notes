## Option Contract
- A contract whose payoff is determined by the fluctuation of some other asset
	- Essentially a bet one the price of stocks or bonds in the future
- Gives you the *right* but not the *obligation* to  buy/sell
	- Unlike [[Forward Contracts]] and [[Futures Contracts]], where you are *obligated*
- Types of contracts
	- [[Call Option]]
	- [[Put Option]]
- **Rate of increase of options**
	- $\text{Increase in Option Value} = \text{Increase in Underlying Price} \times \text{Amount of Option Contract} \times \Delta$
		- Where [[Delta]] is the Greek
- Settlement
	- Options settle next day (T+1)
- Trade on a 100 share basis for equities: a 1$ increase in the underlying will make your call position have a profit of 100$, assuming you're in the money
	- Options on [[Futures Contracts]] trade on a 1:1 
- LEAPS -> long term options
