# Margining Risk
- Risk that you may need to top up margin account on a losing position even if it is offset by another winning position like a hedge
	- Can cause [[Liquidity Risk]] down the line
- The gain from a hedge is non-cash and is [[Marking to Market]], therefore does not qualify to meet margin criteria
## In Valuation Class
- Margining Risk
	- Futures traders need to put up a lot of collateral due to leveraged futures exposure
	- Ex: prices double and return to the previous level, a hedger would need to margin with the entire net worth of his position at 2x
		- More commonly, hedgers who experience this sell out earlier and are unhedged with a cash strain from closing out, exacerbating their bad position - **margining risk**
