# Option Hedging
Most common:

1. [[Protective Put]]:
   - **Strategy**: Buying a put option while holding the underlying asset.
   - **Purpose**: Protects against downside risk in the underlying asset while retaining upside potential.

2. [[Covered Call]]:
   - **Strategy**: Selling a call option while holding the underlying asset.
   - **Purpose**: Generates additional income through the option premium but caps the potential upside of the underlying asset.

3. **Collar**:
   - **Strategy**: Holding the underlying asset, buying a [[Protective Put]], and selling a [[Covered Call]].
   - **Purpose**: Limits both downside risk and upside potential, creating a range of acceptable outcomes.

4. [[Straddle Trade]]
   - **Strategy**: Buying both a call and a put option with the same expiration date (straddle) or different strike prices (strangle).
   - **Purpose**: Profits from significant price movements in either direction, hedging against volatility.

5. [[Delta Hedging]]
   - **Strategy**: Adjusting the position in the underlying asset to offset the delta of the options.
   - **Purpose**: Neutralizes the impact of small price movements in the underlying asset, maintaining a delta-neutral position.

6. **Synthetic Positions**:
   - **Strategy**: Creating a synthetic position using options to replicate the payoff of holding the underlying asset.
   - **Purpose**: Achieves similar risk/reward characteristics as the underlying asset without actually holding it.

7. **Ratio Spreads**:
   - **Strategy**: Holding a different number of options in one direction (e.g., two calls and one put).
   - **Purpose**: Offers a limited-risk, limited-reward profile, often used to hedge against moderate movements in the underlying asset.

8. **Iron Condor**:
   - **Strategy**: Selling an out-of-the-money call and put while buying further out-of-the-money call and put options.
   - **Purpose**: Profits from low volatility in the underlying asset, offering a limited risk and limited reward profile.

9. **Calendar Spreads**:
   - **Strategy**: Buying and selling options with the same strike price but different expiration dates.
   - **Purpose**: Takes advantage of time decay differences between the near-term and long-term options.
