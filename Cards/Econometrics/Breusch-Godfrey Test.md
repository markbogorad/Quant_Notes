# Breusch-Godfrey Test
- AKA lagrange multiplier test
- Uses [[Maximum Likelihood Estimator]] and [[Chi-squared Distribution]]
- Identifies higher order serial correlation (beyond T-1)
- Null: no serial correlation up to X amount of lags (you pick x, should correspond with time series ex monthly obs = 12)
- Breusch-Godfrey is more specific than [[Durbin-Watson Test]], so if you reject this you can reject DW
