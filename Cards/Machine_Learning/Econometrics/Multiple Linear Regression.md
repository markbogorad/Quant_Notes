$$ \begin{equation} y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + \cdots + \beta_n x_n + \epsilon \end{equation} $$
	where
		- **Y:** the dependent variable (variable of interest)
		- **β0​**: intercept term - expected value of Y when all X variables are 0
		- **βn​**: The coefficients of the x variables. Each βi​ represents the *change in the dependent variable y for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable x*​, all else constant.
		- **xn​**: The independent variables used to predict the expected value of y.
		- **ϵ**: The error term (residual) - variability in the model that can't be explained by the linear relationship.

- Attempting to describe a *linear relationship* between (Y) and any other (X) variables
	- The model explains the expected value of the population of Y
