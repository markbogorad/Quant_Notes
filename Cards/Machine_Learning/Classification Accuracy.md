# Classification Accuracy
- The ratio of the number of correct classifications divided by total classifications
$$accuracy = \frac{\text{\# Correct Prediction}}{\text{\# Total predictions}}$$
- May be misleading â†’ if model gets an accuracy of 90%, and has 90% positive instances and 10% negative instances, it doesn't mean model is good if it fails on all negative instances
	- Biased measure
