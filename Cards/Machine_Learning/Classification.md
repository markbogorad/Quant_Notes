# Classification
- Discrete value prediction
	- Output is an integer
- Categorical target (yes or no)
- Based on data, predict if a hedge fund would shut down (1) or remain functional (0)
- `Category (e.g., Status) = f_classification(Input Data)`
- ![[Pasted image 20240822091352.png]]
- Use when data is not linearly seperable
## Types of Classification
- Classification by target
	- Regression models have a continuous target
	- [[Clustering]] models have a categorical target
- Classification by number of inputs and targets
	- Univariate vsa multivariate inputs
	- single vs multi target
