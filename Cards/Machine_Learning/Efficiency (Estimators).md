# Efficiency
- [[Point Estimators]]
- How "well" the estimator is performing compared to other estimators in terms of [[Variance]]
- The **most efficient** estimator is the one with the **lowest variance** among all possible unbiased estimators.
## Efficiency and Bias-Variance Tradeoff:
- Efficiency is often discussed alongside the **bias-variance tradeoff**. While we generally prefer unbiased estimators, a more **efficient** estimator minimizes the spread of estimates around the true parameter. In some cases, a slightly **biased**estimator may have lower variance, making it preferable in practice when balancing bias and variance (e.g., when minimizing **mean squared error**).
