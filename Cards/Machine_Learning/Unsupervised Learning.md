- Given unlabeled data, learn patterns
	- Unlabeled data --> We do not have response variables that interest us (i.e. whether a hedge fund actually shuts down or not), i.e. the outcome
		- Because of this, we **can't make predictions but we can study patterns**
- Common method: [[Clustering]]
	- Groups points with high similarity together in clusters to identify patterns in data.
	- Clusters = f_clustering(Unlabeled Data)
- Common method: [[Dimensionality Reduction]]
	- To transfer high-dimensional data into efficient low-dimensional representations.
	- `Low-dim Representation = f_dimensionality_reduction(High-dim Data)`
- Feature Extraction - feature selection for unlabeled data
