- Modifying the models cost function so we do not model noise (i.e. overfit) by adding a penalty
	- Will treat noise as an outlier
- Avoiding overfitting by penalizing complex functions
	- [[ML Penalty Types]]
		- [[Lasso Regression]]
		- [[Ridge Regression]]
	- Limit hypothesis space
		- Hypothesis space is the possible set of predictors
