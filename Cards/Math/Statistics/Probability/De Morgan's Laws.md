- Rules on probability with [[Complements]]

1) The complement of the union of two sets is the same as the intersection of their complements
$$ (A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c $$
	- The probability that neither of two events will occur is equal to the probability that both do not occur simultaneously.
	- For example, the probability that neither event AA nor event BB occurs is equal to the probability that event AA does not occur and event BB does not occur.


2) The complement of the intersection of two sets is the union of their complements
$$ (A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c $$
	- The probability that at least one of two events does not occur is equal to the probability that one does not occur or the other does not occur.
	- For instance, the probability that at least one of event AA or event BB does not occur is the same as the probability that event AA does not occur or event BB does not occur.
