# Probability Axioms (3)
## Axiom 1: Non-negativity
$$ P(A) \geq 0. $$
- The probability of a single event is **never a negative number**
## Axiom 2: Unitarity
$$ P(S) = 1 $$
- The sample space is 1
## Axiom 3: Additivity
$$ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) $$
- If 2 events are mutually exclusive, the probability of the union of the two is equivalent to the sum of their individual probabilities 
### When applied to an infinite collection of events:
$$ P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A_i) $$
- This just says the probability of all unions between A and I is the sum of all of their individual probabilities
	- The big U is a union over a set of events (instead of 1 event with the small U)
