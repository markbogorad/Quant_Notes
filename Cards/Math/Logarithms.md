# Logarithms
- Logs are the inverse of [[Exponents]]
	- Ln() eliminates e in algebra
- Find the power your object (base) got raised to get an answer
- $\log_b(x) = y \quad \text{if and only if} \quad b^y = x$

**Key Concepts**
- **Base**: The number that is raised to a power. 
	- Common bases  
		- 10 common logarithm -> $log(x)$ or $\log_b(x)$ 
		- e natural logarithm -> written as $ln‚Å°(x)$
- **Argument**: The number x for which we are finding the logarithm.
- **Exponent**: The power to which the base is raised to produce the argument.
## Log Properties
Very similar to exponent rules
- **Product Rule**
	- $\log_b(xy) = \log_b(x) + \log_b(y)$
	- Product log of 2 variables = sum of individual logs of the variables
- **Quotient Rule**
	- $\log_b\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = \log_b(x) - \log_b(y)$
	- Quotient log of 2 variables = difference of individual logs of the variables
- **Power Rule**
	- $\log_b(x^y) = y \log_b(x)$
	- ***Antilog***
	- same as $ln(2^x)$ = $xln(2)$
		- Y exponent sent to the back
- **Change of Base**
	- $\log_b(x) = \frac{\log_k(x)}{\log_k(b)}$
- **Log of 1**
	- $\log_b(1) = 0$
- **Log of Base**
	- $\log_b(b) = 1$
- **Natural Logarithm**
	- $\ln(x) = \log_e(x)$
	- Cannot simplify a `ln` fraction (ex: `ln(48)/ln(2) not equal to ln(24)`)
		- Think of it as it's own operation
