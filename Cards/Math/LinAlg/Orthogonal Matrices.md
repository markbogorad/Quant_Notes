# Orthogonal Matrices
- A square matrix $Q$ is said to be orthogonal if its transpose is equal to its inverse ([[Matrix Inversion]])
	- $Q^TQ=QQ^T=I$ where $I$ is the identity matrix.
- Represents rotations graphically
	- Used in principal component analysis (PCA)
	- Used to ensure factors in factor models ([[Carhart 4 Factor Model]], [[CAPM]]) are uncorrelated
