# [[Correlation]] Matrix
- Correlation is a measure of rescaled covariance:
	- $\rho_{X,Y} = \frac{\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}$       or: the covariance matrix divided by the standard deviations
- Same principles as [[Covariance Matrix]] except this shows covariance
	- See [[Correlation vs Covariance]]

## Think of Correlation Matrix as a Heat Map
