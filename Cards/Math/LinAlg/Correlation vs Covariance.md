# Covariance vs Correlation
- ***Covariance tells you the direction of the linear relationship between variables (whether they change together in the same direction or in opposite directions), while correlation tells you the strength and direction of that relationship in a standardized way.***
- Correlation is a standardized version of covariance. 

[[Covariance]]
- Measures the **extent to which two variables change together**. 
- It indicates whether an increase in one variable corresponds to an increase or decrease in another variable.
- **Formula:** $\text{Cov}(X,Y) = \frac{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{n}$


[[Correlation]]
- Measures both the **strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables**. 
- It is a dimensionless quantity, meaning it does not have units.
- **Formula:** $\rho_{X,Y} = \frac{\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}$
- **Interpretation:**
	- 0.5 to 1.0: Strong positive relationship.
	- 0.3 to 0.5: Moderate positive relationship.
	- 0 to 0.3: Weak positive relationship.
	- If - its same but strength if negative
