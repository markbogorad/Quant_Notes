# Finding Extrema (Maxima/Minima)
- **General Steps:**
1) Determine the domain
	- Open intervals: infinite doman (+- infinity)
	- Closed intervals: from a to b
2) Compute the first order derivative
3) Find critical points
	- Done by setting $f'(x) = 0$
	- Within a to b for closed intervals
4) Analyze critical points
	- 2nd derivarive test
		- **Local Minimum**: $f''(x)>0$
		- **Local Maximum**: $f''(x)<0$
		- **Inconclusive**: $f''(x)=0$ might indicate a point of inflection or require further analysis.
	- 1st derivative test
		- Analyze sign change of $f'(x)$ around the critical points
		- Negative to positive: **local minimum**
		- Positive to negative: **local maximum**
5) Evaluate endpoints (for closed intervals only)
	- Plug in the a and b values from the interval into $f(x)$
		- Ex: At $x=−2: f(−2)=(−2)^3−3(−2)=−8+6=−2$
			- At $x=2x: f(2)=2^3−3(2)=8−6=2$
	- These give you **global extrema**
