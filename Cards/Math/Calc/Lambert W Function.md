# Lambert W
- Denoted as $W(x)$
- Defined as the inverse function of $f(W)=We^W$. 
	- In other words, if you have an equation of the form $y=We^W$, then $W=W(y)$ is the value that satisfies this equation.
- For a given value y, the Lambert W function W(y) is the solution to: 
	- $y=W(y)e^{W(y)}$
## Use
- Any time you see $xe^x$
## Branching
- W Lambert function can have multiple solutions
## Example
- $xe^x = 20$ 
	- y = 20, x = x
	- Insert:
		- x = W(20), which is roughly 2.842
