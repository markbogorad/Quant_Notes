# Limits
- Limits describe the value of a function as it approaches something else, usually infinity
	- **To answer:** think what is this function going towards (approaching) ?
		- When working with infinity:
			- Higher power in numerator = infinity
			- Higher power in denominator = 0
- Treat them as algebraic equations until the end, then *plug in limit* to understand the answer
