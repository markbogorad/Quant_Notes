# Partial Derivatives
- Multivariate calculus
- Measures the rate of change of a function as one if it's variables changes and the other(s) are kept constant
- Notation (example partial derivative of f(x) with respect to x):
	- $f(x,y)$$\frac{∂f}{∂x}​$  -> derivative of f with respect to x keeping y constant
	- Mathematically, it's defined as: 
		- $\frac{∂f}{∂x}​$   $=lim⁡_{Δx→0}$ $\frac{f(x+Δx,y)−f(x,y)}{Δx}$
	- With respect to Y is:
		- $\frac{∂f}{∂y}​$   $=lim⁡_{Δy→0}$ $\frac{f(x,y+Δy)−f(x,y)}{Δy}$
## Solving
- To get X, derive with respect to X and *treat Y as a constant*
## Mixed Partial Derivative
- A higher order partial derivative where first you derive with respect to X, then with respect to Y
	- $\frac{∂^2f}{∂x∂y} or f_{xy}$
