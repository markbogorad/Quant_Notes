# Central Limit Theorem
- The Central Limit Theorem states that if you take many i.i.d. random variables and calculate their sum (or average), the distribution of this sum will **approximate a normal distribution as the sample size increases**, regardless of the original distribution of the variables.
$$\frac{\sqrt{n} (\bar{X}_n - \mu)}{\sigma} \to Z \quad \text{as } n \to \infty,$$
- A fundamental theorem of [[Probability MOC]]
- The distribution of any large number of i.i.d. random variables tends towards the [[Normal Distribution]] as the number of observations tends towards infinity
