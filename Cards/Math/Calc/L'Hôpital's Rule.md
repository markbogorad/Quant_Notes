# L'HÃ´pital's Rule
- Rule on [[Limits]] using [[Derivatives]]
- Differentiating the numerator and denominator separately get the limit
## The Rule
- Basically, if the equation is indeterminate (0/0 or infinity/infinity), you can do the equation by working with it's [[Derivatives]]

**Formal:**
- If $(\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)})$ results in an indeterminate form of type $(\frac{0}{0})$ or $(\frac{\infty}{\infty})$, and the derivatives \( f'(x) \) and \( g'(x) \) exist near \( c \) (except possibly at \( c \)), then:
$[\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}]$ provided the limit on the right-hand side exists or is $(\pm \infty)$.

## How to Solve:
- Verify indeterminant type $(\frac{0}{0})$ or $(\frac{\infty}{\infty})$
- Take derivatives of numerator and denominator
- Solve new fraction
