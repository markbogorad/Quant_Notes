# Implicit Differentiation
- *Intuition*:
	- Solving 1 derivative in terms of the other
	- Taking a derivative of 2 variables and analyzing their relationship, where they offset each other, thus the equation usually is equal to 0
	- ![[Pasted image 20240630220612.png]]
		- In this example, as the ladder falls by 1 meter per second, the distance from ladder to wall increase by 4/3 of a meter per 1 second
			- *1 variable is in relation to another*
	- Setting equal to 0 keeps you on the tangent line, necessary to keep the variables in relation of one to the other without throwing in additional factors
## The Process 
- Finding $\frac{dy}{dx}$ by doing 2 derivatives
	- Intuition: if $dx$ and $dy$ both change by a single unit, how much will $\frac{dy}{dx}$ change
- When you can't solve a [[Derivatives]] function explicitly in one variable in terms of another
	- Particularly when you can't isolate variables and cancel 
- Think of this in terms of the coordinate plane
	- Slope =  $\frac{dy}{dx}$ = rise over run
	- Implicit curve: the set of all points (x and y) that satisfy a given property written in terms of the two variables
## Steps
- Differentiate both variables and add a `dx` or `dy` to the variables 
	- Ex: $x^2 + y^2 = 5^2$ becomes $2x dx + 2y dy = 0$ 
		- Rearrange to model in terms of $\frac{dy}{dx}$ to get $-x/y$
