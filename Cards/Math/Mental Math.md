## 2 Digit Numbers by 11
- Sandwich method
- Ex: 32 * 11
	- Add first 2 digits and put in between
	- 3.  (3+2).   2=      352
- If overruns:
	- 85 * 11 = (8+1) .... (3 from 13) ...(5).  =   935

## Squaring 5s
- If number ends in 5
- Answer begins by multiplying the 1st digit by the next higher digit
- Answer ends in 25
- Ex: 35^2 = 3(4)..25 = 1225

## Same first digit, 2nd digits add to 10
- Ex: 83 * 87 
- Similar rule as squaring above, except its followed by the product of the 2nd two
- 8 * 9 ... and (7 * 3)= 7221

## Addition/Subtraction
- 2 main ways
	- **Simplify**
		- Ex: 759 + 496 is the same as 759 + 500 - 4 = 1259-4 = 1225
	- **Right to left**
		- ![[Pasted image 20240630093348.png]]
- Same principles for subtraction
	- If requires borrowing (subtracting a number above 7 or so), do the simplification method
## Multiplication (1x2 and 1x3)
- Works by distributive property
- Left to right
	- ![[Pasted image 20240630133426.png]]
- Rounding
	- Useful or when numbers end in 8 or 9
	- ex: 69 * 6 = (70 * 6) - 6
## Multiplication (2x2)
- Addition Method
	- Preform 2 1x2 multiplications and add
	- ![[Pasted image 20240630184157.png]]
	- Always break up the number with the smaller digit to make the addition easier
		- Only exception is if you're around 50, will be easier with 50x
- Subtraction method
	- Only useful if a number that you're multiplying ends in 8 or 9
	- ![[Pasted image 20240630184609.png]]
	- 
## Squaring (2x2)
- Works because of difference of squares principle
	- $(z+d)^2 = z^2 + 2zd + d^2 = z(z+2d)+d^2$
- ![[Pasted image 20240630170710.png]]
	- Take +- distances to nearest 10th, then add the square of that difference 
## Division
- Figure out a band in which the answer will lie
- Ex: 179/7
	- Looking for a number such that 7 * X = 179
		- X will be somewhere between 20 (140) and 30 (210)
			- 179 - 140 = 39
				- So 20 + (7/39) = 25 and 4/7
- How it looks mentally
	- ![[Pasted image 20240730163959.png]]
- When there is a 5 --> double the numbers and divide by 10
	- **Dividing by 10 always makes it easier**
- Same thing for 25 or 75 --> multiply by 4 (75 is 300)
- Dividing by 11
	- Its the digit on the left and on the right, unless right digit is greater than left
		- Ex: 352/11 = 32.     or    715/11 = 65

## Decimalization
- 1/2 = 0.5
- 1/3 = 0.333 increments
- 1/4 = 0.25 increments
- 1/5 = 0.20 increments
- 1/6 = 0.1666 increments --> only need 1/6 and 5/6 which is 0.8333 (the rest are 1/3rds)
- 1/8 = 0.125 increments
- 1/9
	- ![[Pasted image 20240730181809.png]]
- 1/11 = 0.909 (becomes multiples of 9)
	- ![[Pasted image 20240730181829.png]]
- 1/7
	- ![[Pasted image 20240730182003.png]]
		- Like multiples of 7 starting at 2
		- Its also a sequence of the same exact numbers in this patter --> 142857 going clockwise
## Checking Divisibility
- 2 --> just if its an even number
- 4 --> if the last 2 digits are even (ex: 45,3*24*)
- 8 --> last 3 digits divisible by 8 or if not divisible by 4 , then not divisible by 8
- 3 --> if sum of all digits is divisible by 3 (57682 = 27, so divisible)
	- Same for 9
	- 6 must be divisible by 3 and even
- 11 -->
