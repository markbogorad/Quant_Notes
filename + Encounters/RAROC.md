# Risk Adjusted Return on Capital
> Considering the short sale of a stock at $20, if we are comfortable assuming we can *lose no more than $10*, that is a reasonable measure of capital. Therefore a *$1 profit would represent a 10% return on risk capital*. In the case of the oil forward contract, if the maximum loss were $5, we could say the $1 profit was a 20% return on risk capital.
