# Computer Network
- A collection of interconnected computing devices that can communicate with each other to share resources and information
- The primary purpose of a computer network is to enable the sharing of data, resources, and services among multiple users and systems.
## Protocols
- Rules and conventions for communication between network devices (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP).
- IP Address
	- (Internet Protocol Addresses) are unique *numerical labels* assigned to devices connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. 
	- An IP address serves two main functions: identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the host in the network
- TCP
	- (Transmission Control Protocol)  
	- *Ensures* reliable, ordered, and error-checked *delivery* of data between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network. 
	- TCP is connection-oriented, meaning it establishes a connection between the sender and receiver before data transmission begins and ensures data integrity through various mechanisms:
- DNS
	- (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for devices connected to the Internet or a private network. 
	- *It translates human-readable domain names* (e.g., [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)) *into IP addresses* (e.g., 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other on the network. 
	- DNS is essential for navigating the web, as it allows users to access websites using easy-to-remember names rather than numerical IP addresses.
- HTTP
	- (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application-layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as [[HTML]]. 
	- It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. 
	- HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands.
## Computer Networking
- **Networking** refers to the practice of connecting computers and other devices together to share resources and information. 
- It encompasses the design, implementation, management, and maintenance of these connections to ensure efficient and secure data communication.
## Types of Networks
- **Local Area Network (LAN)**: A network that spans a small geographic area, like an office building or home.
- **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: A network that spans a large geographic area, often a country or continent. The Internet is the largest WAN.
- **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**: A network that covers a city or a large campus.
- **Personal Area Network (PAN)**: A network for personal devices, typically within a range of a few meters (e.g., Bluetooth).
- **Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)**: A LAN that uses wireless technology, such as Wi-Fi, to connect devices.
