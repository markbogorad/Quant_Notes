- This does NOT involve expectation
	- Traditional [[Contango & Backwardation Markets]] is based on expectation
- 2 main conclusions
	- Producers are naturally short futures
	- To attract speculators, futures are **set below expected spot price**, offering a **risk premium**
## Risk Premium under Normal Backwardation
$$RP = E_t(S(T)) - S(t) + (S(t) - F(t,T))$$
- Risk premium = expected change in the spot price + the [[Oil Own Rate]] (extrapolated from futures)
- In normal backwardation, risk premium is **positive**

- Risk premia dynamics are reversed in Contango
## Hedging Equilibrium Proof
- A proof for normal backwardation by applying optimization to producers, consumers, and speculators
- [[Oil Hedging Equilibrium]]
## Empirical Proof
- Examine a passive long strategy: buying and rolling oil futures
	- This strategy has 10% annualized log return
		- Considering leverage this is 5-10X higher
