# Quantamental Oil Strategies
- In contrast to the risk premia strategies, these are fully quant strategies
- Based on quantitative signals with a fundamental overlay
- For quant strategies, traders don't like to speculate on price, **instead they bet on spreads**
	- Spreads are less volatile and need to be leveraged
	- **Most popular spread:** first and 2nd nearest to maturity futures ([[Time (Calendar) Spreads]])
