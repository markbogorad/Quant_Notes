# Encryption
- Subset of [[Cryptography]], referring to the process of transforming information to make it unreadable to unauthorized users
- This process ensures that only authorized parties can access the original information. 
- When the intended recipient receives the ciphertext, they can decrypt it back into plaintext using a corresponding decryption key.
## Types

| Type of Encryption             | Key Characteristics                         | Example Algorithms/Applications                    | Common Use Cases                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Symmetric                      | Same key for encryption and decryption      | AES, DES                                           | File encryption, database encryption               |
| Asymmetric                     | Public and private key pair                 | RSA, ECC                                           | Key exchange, digital signatures                   |
| **End-to-End**                 | Encryption from sender to recipient         | WhatsApp, Signal                                   | Secure messaging, confidential communication       |
| **Enhanced**                   | Advanced techniques and stronger algorithms | Combining symmetric and asymmetric encryption, TLS | High-security applications, financial transactions |
| Transport Layer Security (TLS) | Encrypts data in transit over the internet  | HTTPS websites, secure email communication         | Securing web traffic, email communication          |
| Full Disk Encryption (FDE)     | Encrypts entire disk drive                  | BitLocker, FileVault                               | Protecting data on devices in case of theft/loss   |
