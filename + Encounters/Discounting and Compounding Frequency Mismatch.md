# Discounting and Compounding Frequency Mismatch
- Payment frequency -> number of payments per period
- Discount frequency -> number of periods used to discount the cash flows
- Ex: [[Loans Amortization]]
	- Interest rate on the loan is annual (discount frequency)
	- Payments are made on a monthly basis (payment frequency)
- **Solution: use the standard rate convention**
	- Divide the **interest** rate by 12
