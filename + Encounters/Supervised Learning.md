# Supervised Learning
- Core idea -> **labels allow the model to be taught** 
	- computer will learn a function to map inputs to outputs
- Think of supervised learning as creating a model out of a matrix of features ([[Matrices]], [[Feature Selection Techniques]])
# Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
- Differences
	- Supervised learning is trained on a labeled dataset (unsupervised is not)
		- Labeled data is input - output pairs, which is used to train models
		- f : X -> Y
	- Output
		- Supervised output is a value or label
		- Unsupervised output is a pattern, cluster, or structure
	- Usage
		- Supervised is used for predictive tasks
		- Unsupervised is used for explanatory data analysis and understanding the intrinsic nature of the data
## Common Use Cases
- [[Classification]]
- [[Regression]]


- Nothing more than an Excel spreadsheet or a [[Pandas Dataframes]]
