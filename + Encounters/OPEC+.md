- They don't buy futures, instead their presence affects spreads and risk premia
OPEC, or the **Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries**, is a group of major oil-exporting nations that coordinates and unifies petroleum policies among member countries to ensure the stabilization of oil markets. OPEC aims to secure fair and stable prices for petroleum producers, efficient and economic supply to consuming nations, and a fair return on capital for investors in the industry.

### Key Details:
1. **Founded**: September 1960 in Baghdad, Iraq.
2. **Headquarters**: Vienna, Austria.
3. **Current Members** (as of 2025):
   - Algeria
   - Angola
   - Congo
   - Equatorial Guinea
   - Gabon
   - Iran
   - Iraq
   - Kuwait
   - Libya
   - Nigeria
   - **Saudi Arabia (de facto leader)**
   - United Arab Emirates
   - Venezuela
   
   **Note**: Membership may change due to economic or political factors.

4. **Role in the Global Market**:
   - OPEC sets oil production targets for its member nations to influence global oil prices.
   - It acts as a powerful cartel, controlling a significant percentage of the world's oil supply.

5. **OPEC+**:
   - In 2016, OPEC expanded its cooperation to include non-member oil-producing nations, such as **Russia**, forming OPEC+. This alliance jointly coordinates production levels to manage supply and influence global oil prices.

### Key Functions:
- **Production Quotas**: OPEC assigns production quotas to its members, which can significantly impact global oil supply and prices.
- **Market Stabilization**: By adjusting output, OPEC tries to balance demand and supply, avoiding excessive price volatility.
- **Economic Influence**: OPEC's decisions impact energy markets, geopolitics, and economies worldwide.

OPEC's influence has fluctuated over time, particularly with the rise of non-OPEC producers (e.g., the U.S. shale industry), but it remains a key player in the global energy sector.



# OPEC+
OPEC+ is an expanded coalition of oil-producing nations that includes both the **Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)** and a group of key non-OPEC oil exporters. The group was formed in **2016** to enhance cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers in managing global oil supply and stabilizing prices.

### Key Details:
1. **Purpose**:
   - To collectively manage oil production levels and influence global oil markets.
   - To stabilize oil prices, reduce volatility, and ensure a balance between oil supply and demand.

2. **Members**:
   - **OPEC Members**: Include countries like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, UAE, Venezuela, and others.
   - **Non-OPEC Members** (key ones include):
     - **Russia** (a leading non-OPEC member and co-leader with Saudi Arabia)
     - Kazakhstan
     - Mexico
     - Oman
     - Azerbaijan
     - Malaysia
     - Sudan and South Sudan
     - Brunei
     
     Membership can vary based on participation in production agreements.

3. **Key Activities**:
   - **Production Cuts**: OPEC+ often agrees to cut or increase oil production collectively to address supply-demand imbalances. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, OPEC+ implemented historic production cuts to stabilize plummeting oil prices.
   - **Monitoring Supply**: They regularly meet to assess global oil market conditions and adjust their production targets accordingly.
   - **Balancing Power**: The coalition balances the interests of traditional OPEC nations and emerging non-OPEC producers.

4. **Leadership**:
   - Saudi Arabia and Russia are the primary drivers of OPEC+ decisions, often negotiating directly to align interests.

5. **Impact on Global Markets**:
   - OPEC+ decisions significantly impact global oil prices, energy markets, and the broader economy.
   - Their actions affect importers, exporters, and industries reliant on stable energy costs.

### Why OPEC+ Matters:
OPEC+ is a strategic alliance that enhances the influence of OPEC countries by combining their efforts with other major oil producers. Together, they control a large share of the world's oil supply, giving them substantial leverage over global energy prices and geopolitical dynamics.
