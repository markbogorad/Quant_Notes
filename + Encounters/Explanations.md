# Explanations
- This phase focuses on interpreting models, visualizing results, and relating findings to existing theory.
- **Importance**: Measures the importance of different features and can be either specific to a model or agnostic.
- **Examples**: Uses different types of examples like prototypical, counterfactual, and contrastive to explain model predictions.
- **Visualizations**: Employs various visualization techniques to help interpret model predictions.
- **Theory**: Compares model predictions with existing theoretical frameworks to ensure coherence and understandability.
