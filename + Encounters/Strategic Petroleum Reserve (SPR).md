# SPR
- Worlds largest supply of emergency oil stocks
- Held by U.S. government
- Established after oil embargo 1974 by [[OPEC+]], at the time OAPEC (arabic)
- Mission: diminish impact on petroleum supplies
## Case Study Involving [[Oil Own Rate]]
- In 2021, the SPR offered 9.1% oil loans (this means borrower will need to give 9.1% more barrels)
	- Done to replenish the SPR
- Why would anyone do this when risk free rates were near 0?
	- Market implied oil own rate was actually around 20% at the time because of steep backwardation ([[Contango & Backwardation Markets]])
		- Assuming no frictions, this would have been an 11% arbitrage
			- Frictions do exist, but some players can arbitrage here -> U.S. government created an arbitrage opportunity
	- **Arbitrage:** borrow from US govt at 9%, sell these barrels in spot market, buy 30-month futures at 20% discount and take delivery at 30 months
