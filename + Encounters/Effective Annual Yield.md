# Effective Annual Yield (EAY)
- The effective annual yield is the actual return an investor earns on a bond due to compounding. It accounts for the effect of **reinvesting coupon payments** and is given by:

$$1+\text{EAY} = \left(1 + \frac{i}{n}\right)^n$$
where:
- $i$ is the periodic (semiannual or quarterly) coupon rate,
- $n$Â is the number of compounding periods in a year (e.g., 2 for semiannual or 4 for quarterly compounding).
