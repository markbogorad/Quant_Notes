# Continuous Random Variables
- Variables that can take an infinite number of possible values within a given range. 
	- Unlike discrete random variables, which can only take specific, countable values, continuous random variables can assume any value within a continuum, typically within an interval on the real number line.
	- Probability of taking any exact number is 0, this would be discrete
- [[Probability Density Function (PDF)]] for continuous random variables
$$P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_{a}^{b} f_X(x) \, dx$$
- Probability that a variable lies between 2 values
