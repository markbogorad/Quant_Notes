# Liquidity Measures
 Measures:
		- Xetra: round trip liquidity (to both buy and sell something)
		- Barclays: uses notional amounts traded and then aggregates by weighting by currency pair
		- Illiquidity also used
			- $ILLIQ = \frac{1}{N}\sum |{r_k}| / V_k$
				- r -> return
				- V -> trading volume
