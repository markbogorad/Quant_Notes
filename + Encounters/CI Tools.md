# CI (Continuous Integration)
- CI is a development practice where developers integrate code into a **shared repository** frequently, typically several times a day.
- **Purpose**: The goal is to detect and address integration issues early by automatically testing each integration. This helps ensure that the code is always in a deployable state.
- **Key Practices**:
    - Automated Builds: Every code change triggers an automated build and test process.
    - Code Reviews: Changes are reviewed and merged frequently to avoid integration issues.
    - Unit Tests: Automated tests are run to validate the changes before they are integrated.
- **CI Tools**: [[Jenkins]], CircleCI, Travis CI, GitLab CI, Bamboo
