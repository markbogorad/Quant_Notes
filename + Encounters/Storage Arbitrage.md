# Storage Arbitrage
- A [[Real Options]] on time
	- Sell when it becomes convenient to do so
- Professional storage traders to not take directional positions
	- Hedged with [[Futures Contracts]]
- No arbitrage boundary
	- $F(t,T) \leq S(t) + U + R$
	- U = cost of storage
	- Futures price cant be higher than spot + convenience yield + cost of finanicng
- High cost of storage raises (exacerbates) contango
	- [[Contango & Backwardation Markets]]
## Practicalities
- Market participants rarely build up excess storage for when it comes time for it to be beneficial
	- Instead, the operation system is very well optimized, so everything arrived just in time and just in right quantity
- Cheapest form of storage is in underground salt caverns
