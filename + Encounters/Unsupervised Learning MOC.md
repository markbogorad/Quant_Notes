- [[Unsupervised Learning]] - any method that forms anew feature space by minimizing a loss function
	- [[Clustering]] -- need to be standardized and normalized before this is done (these are preprocessing methods)
		- Connectivity Models
			- Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
		- Centroid Models - need to pre-specify clusters
		- Validation techniques - slihouette and calinski-harabaz
	- [[Dimensionality Reduction]]
		- [[Principle Component Analysis (PCA)]]
		- [[Grouping (ML)]]
	- K Means Clustering
 - Alternative Data
