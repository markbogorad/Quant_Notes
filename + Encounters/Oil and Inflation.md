# Oil and Inflation
- Oil futures tend to rise with rising inflation
	- One of the only assets that does this
- This is because oil directly passes through onto CPI via gas prices
- 5y5y forward breakeven rate
	- 5 year inflation measured by 5 year forwards
		- Approximated with twice 10 year inflation minus 5 year inflation
	- This actually closely follows WTI futures, useful for forecasting
		- *Level* of commodity changes with % change in CPI
- Oil has been a superior hedge to unexpected changes in inflation when compared to gold and real estate
	- Pension funds use oil actually
