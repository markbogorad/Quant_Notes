| Aspect                   | [[Agile Development]]                                                                                      | [[SDLC]]                                                                |

| **Flexibility**          | More flexible and adaptive to changes                                                                      | More rigid (e.g., Waterfall model)                                      |
| **Customer Involvement** | Customers are involved throughout the development process                                                  | Customers are typically involved mainly at the beginning and end        |
| **Delivery**             | Delivers small, functional pieces of software frequently                                                   | Often results in a single, final product release                        |
| **Risk Management**      | Manages risk by delivering work in small increments, allowing for early detection and correction of issues | Higher risk due to late integration and testing (e.g., Waterfall model) |
