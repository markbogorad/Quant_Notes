- **Repository**:
	- A repository (or repo) is the central storage location where all the files and their revision history are kept. It can be hosted locally on your computer or on a remote server.
- **Commit**:
	- A commit is a record of changes made to the files in the repository. Each commit has a unique identifier (usually a hash) and includes metadata such as the author, date, and a commit message describing the changes
- **Branch**:
	- A branch is a separate line of development. Branches *allow you to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without affecting the main codebase*. Once the work is complete, branches can be merged back into the main branch.
- **Merge:**
	- Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. It helps combine different lines of development into a single codebase.
