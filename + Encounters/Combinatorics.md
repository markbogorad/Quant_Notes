## Principle of counting
- The amount ways an event can occur is comprised of $N*M$ events
	- Where N is outcomes for event A and M is outcomes for event B
- Used for **finding sample space**
	- Commonly $N^M$ for
## Permutations
- Order matters
- Amount of different **ordered** arrangements possible (ex: HT, HH, TT, TH)
$$(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$
- n = total possible outcomes
- k = number of outcomes you are examining/selecting
## Combinations
- Order doesn't matter
$$(n,r) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$
- Written often as $\binom{n}{k}$
	- $k$ different groups that can be selected out of $n$ options
	- n = total possible outcomes
	- k = number of outcomes you are examining/selecting
- Selecting components out of the counting principle
