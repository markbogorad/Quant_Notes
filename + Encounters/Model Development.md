# Model Development
- This is where models are developed, trained, and validated.
- **Labels**: The development of target variables or labels, which are what models aim to predict.
- **Specification**: The process of defining model types, such as supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning, hybrid models, or handcrafted models.
- **Validation**: Involves assessing model performance and robustness.
- **Results**: This step reassesses model validity using out-of-sample data to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
