# Clustering
- An unsupervised learning technique (see [[Supervised Learning vs Unsupervised Learning]])
- Discovers inherent groupings
- The main objective of clustering is to partition a dataset into clusters, where each cluster contains data points that are similar to each other according to some measure, and different from data points in other clusters.

## Centroid Based Clustering
- Clusters are represented by a central point (centroid), which may or may not be an actual data point.
-  Partitions the data into k clusters, each represented by the centroid (mean) of the points in the cluster. It iteratively assigns data points to the nearest centroid and updates the centroids until convergence.

## Density Based Clustering
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):** Forms clusters based on the density of data points in a region. It can identify clusters of arbitrary shapes and is effective at identifying outliers.

- **Hierarchical Clustering:**
    
    - Builds a tree-like structure (dendrogram) of clusters, either by iteratively merging smaller clusters into larger ones (agglomerative) or by splitting larger clusters into smaller ones (divisive).
    - **Example:**
        - **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering:** Starts with each data point as its own cluster and merges the closest pairs of clusters iteratively until all points are in a single cluster.
- **Distribution-Based Clustering:**
    
    - Assumes that data points are generated by a mixture of underlying probability distributions, with each cluster corresponding to a distribution.
    - **Example:**
        - **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):** Assumes data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions and assigns data points to clusters based on the probability of their belonging to each distribution.
- **Model-Based Clustering:**
    
    - Involves using a model to assume the number and structure of clusters and then fitting the model to the data.
    - **Example:**
        - **Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm:** An iterative method to find maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in statistical models, where the model depends on unobserved latent variables, often used in GMMs.
