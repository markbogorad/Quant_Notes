# Convenience Yield
- *Convenience yields and storage costs are never directly observable*
	- Can only extrapolate combined effect from futures [[Term Structure of Interest Rates]]
- Convenience yields dominate storage costs, implying a constantly positive [[Oil Own Rate]]
	- [[Theory of Normal Backwardation]]
- Connects oil rate of interest with the [[The Carry Trade]]
	- Spot price and futures price must have no arbitrage
- Formula for commodity [[Futures Contracts]] incorporating [[Storage Arbitrage]] and convenience yields
$$F(t,T = S(t)e^{(r+u-y)(T-t)}$$
- **Own rate**: $b = y - u$ 
	- Own rate = benefits of consumption - cost of storing
## Convenience of Holding Oil
- **Transactional and precautionary motive:** more efficient for a refinery to hold extra barrels to accommodate short term demand adjustments
- **Speculative motive:** refineries have superior inventory knowledge, may be trading on this
