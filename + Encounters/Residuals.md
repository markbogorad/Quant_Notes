# Residuals
- Residuals are the error between predicted y and actual y
- Should follow a [[Normal Distribution]], mean 0 variance $\mu$
- [[I.I.D]] -> implies error is independent of X
## White Noise
- A specific case when the residuals are behaving as intended (mean 0, constant variance, no autocorrelation), i.e. the residuals are [[Stationarity]]
