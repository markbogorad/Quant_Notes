## Probability Context
- Cauchy-Schwarz provides a bound on the absolute value of the [[Covariance]] between two random variables
$$\left|\text{Cov}(X, Y)\right| \leq \sqrt{\text{Var}(X) \cdot \text{Var}(Y)}$$
- Specifically, it states that the absolute value of the covariance between two random variables X and Y is **less than or equal to the product of the standard deviations of X and Y.**
- If X or Y is deterministic, then covariance is 0
- It is an equality when X is a multiply of Y or Y is a multiple of X (colinear)
