# Market Structures
- Order driven
	- Continuous Markets
		- Traders trade among themselves
		- Everyone can place a limit order
		- Price priority in LOB
- Call Markets
	- Trading is arranged at a predetermined set time (usually few times per day)
	- All orders are batched and sold at one point in time
	- Pro: all interest of a particular instrument is concentrated on 1 moment
- Crossing networks
	- Mostly derivative markets
	- Price matching derived from other primary markets
	- Trasing doesn't direcly impact price here -> some like to offload blocks in these markets
	- quote driven markets
		- Only dealers make the market (have ability to submit market orders)
		- Auctions -> price defined via "price discovery"
- Alternative Trading Systems
	- SEC regulated but not registered as exchanges
	- No listing new securities 
	- A source of alternative exposure to trading -> benefit of lower latency and lower fees
	- 2 types:
		- ECN -> Anonymous LOB with near instant matching. Works on price discovery (auction style)
		- Crossing Network -> No price discovery, instead orders are matched upon quoted prices in the primary markets
			- AKA dark pools (300-500 shares but can also be sold off in micro bits)
