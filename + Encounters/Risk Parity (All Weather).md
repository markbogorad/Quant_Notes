# Risk Parity AKA All Weather Strategy
- An investment strategy created by Ray Dallio thats effective for oil and [[Oil and Inflation]] trading
- Premise: Allocate larger notional investments to lower volatility assets (bonds) and get exposure to any direction by allocating the remaining assets to whichever risky class you want
- In oil context, a 90-10 allocation with bonds and oil futures becomes a unique hedge to unexpected inflation changes
- **Simply volatility matching via portfolio weights**
