# Opportunity Cost in Valuation Context
- Allows you to incorporate the possibility of earning a higher interest elsewhere
	- Ex: Shimko car bond example -> the guy didn't want to spend 10k in principal to save 500$ when he returns way more on 10K in his other investments
- **Mechanics:**
	- If you're looking to invest 10k from a savings account @ 3% p.a., your opportunity cost is $10,000 \times 0.03 = 300$
	- Risk charge ([[General Valuation Equation (GVE)]]) = total return - opportunity cost
- Discount rates refer to opportunity cost -> how much it costs to invest into an asset
	- Rates of return on the contrary refer to % returns
