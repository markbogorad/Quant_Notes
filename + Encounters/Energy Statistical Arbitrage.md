# Energy Statistical Arbitrage
- Based on presence of [[Cointegration]] a linear combination of the 2 time series is stationary
	- This implies the variance of the time series is finite, and will not deviate too far from it's mean
	- Again, the time series are spreads in practice
- Key challenge is picking the right pairs
- Multivariate statistical arbitrage also possible:
## Multiple Products Example
- Analogy: the petroleum complex can be imagined as a mall with multiple floors
![[Pasted image 20250117200914.png]]
- Floor 1: all crude oils (colors i.e. by column)
- Floor 2: refined products (by row)
- A brand of a certain "store" would have 2 floors
- Can even add [[Natural Gas]] to the statistical arbitrage portfolio

## Conclusions
- Energy statistical arbitrage is susceptible to black swan events messing things up
	- The oil markets are highly efficient markets (things are delivered right place right time always), so any time there is an error it causes a domino effect
- **It is a short volatility strategy with negative skewness in returns**
