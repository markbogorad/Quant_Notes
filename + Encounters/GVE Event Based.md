### GVE: Loss Events
- When there is an event where the cost (like a default) is measurable with a probability
- Attach a $-\pi$ to the $V_0$ in the capital gain step
#### Auto Insurance (multiple events affecting a valuation)
$$V_0 = \frac{\pi C}{(r-k)+\delta}$$
- C is payoff in case of accident
- $\pi$ is probability of an accident
- $\delta$ is probability of death
- $k$ is premium paid out to insurer
- **Probability of cash event / probability of termination event**
#### Corporate bond with constant default rate $\lambda$
- Default bond into default-able and non default-able
- Non default-able = PV of non default-able part $\times (1-\lambda)$
- Default-able (risky bit) = $\lambda \times$ PV of risky part
#### Credit risk
- [[Credit Risk]]

$$rV_0 + kV_0 = (0-V_0)+(1-\pi\lambda)C$$
$$V_0 = \frac{C}{1+r+k+\pi\lambda}$$
