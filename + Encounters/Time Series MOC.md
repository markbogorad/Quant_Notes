## Time Series
- [[Time Series]]
- [[Trend]]
- [[Cyclicality]]
- [[Seasonality]]
- [[Disturbance (error)]]
- [[Stationarity]]

- Maximum Likelihood - wilmott65
- Cointegration - wilmott 71
- Garch - 174
- serial correlation 185
- variance of mean return

- [[Yule Asymmetry]]
	- If the data that is the average between quartiles 0.75 and 0.25 (from numerator), then skewness will be shown when analyzing the difference between the average of those and the quartile at 0.5
- Lag Operator
	- L^2 = Yt - 2
	- Translate ARMA in lag operator notation
	- Purpose: to make equations into the characteristic polynomials, which allow you to characterize weak stationarity
- Theorem for week 2: an arma process is stationary if the roots of the characteristic polynomial P(z) are outside of the unit circle -> put under staionarity
## Misc
- [[Error vs Residual]]
- [[Expectation]]

	- EDA/TSA --> explanatory data analysis / time series analysis
		- 
- [[Time Series, Cross Sectional, Panel Data]]
- Autocorrelation --> is the data being compressed?, what effect does the lagged value have on tomorrows value
	- Stationarity --> statistical properties stay the same over time
