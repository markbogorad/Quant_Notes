# Discrete Conditional Probabilities
- When you know 1 of the variables in a joint distribution (aka conditional [[Random Variables]])
## Conditional PMF (discrete)
$$P(X = x \mid Y = y) = \frac{P(X = x \cap Y = y)}{P(Y = y)}$$
- Where
	- $P(X=x∩Y=y)$ is the joint probability that both $X=x$ and $Y=y$ occur.
	- $P(Y=y)$ is the marginal probability that $Y=y$ occurs.
