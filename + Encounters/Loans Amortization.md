- Similar payment structure to a bond
	- Lower rate and less flexibility for borrowers
	- Not publicly traded
- **Excel: default probability not auto-included**
## Exponential Default Model
- Valued as a **growing annuity** with [[General Valuation Equation (GVE)]]
- $r V_0 = \left( -\frac{c}{(1+r)^n} - p V_0 \right) + C \; \rightarrow \; r^* V_0 = -\frac{c}{(1+r)^n} + C$
	- $-\frac{c}{(1+r)^n} +C$ is the growing annuity component
	- $r^*$ is the growth rate for the annuity $(0.001+0.002)/(1-0.002)=0.003006$
#### Amortization
