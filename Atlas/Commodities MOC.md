## Energy Markets General
- Physical vs Financial Markets
	- Physical: actual making or taking delivery of the commodity
		- Economics of physical markets (retail market (i.e. to end use customer))
			- Demand is inelastic
			- Limited storage in retail markets --> consumers cant always buy when prices are low or sell all stored products when prices are high because there is not enough storage
			- Not mane substitutes
			- Necessity factor --> consumers MUST buy at times, otherwise there will be blackouts, etc
	- Financial: no direct delivery of commodity, just an exchange of cash
