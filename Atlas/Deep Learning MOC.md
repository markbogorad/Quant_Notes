## Deep Learning
- [[Neural Network]] --> can work with non stationary data
	- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) -> layered pattern recognition
	- [[Propagation (Forward and Backward)]]
	- N Beats Model
- Machine Intelligence
- Deep Learning for Volatility
- Dimensionality Reduction
- GANs
	- The frist version of generative ML (like AI)
	- Composed of 2 neural network models
	- Can generate realistic time series data
