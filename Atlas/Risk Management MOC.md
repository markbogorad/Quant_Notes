## Hedging
- Derivatives Hedging
	- Hedging output price risk: A gold-mining company can fix the selling price of gold by selling gold futures.
	-  Hedging input cost: A sausage maker can hedge input prices by buying pork belly futures.
	-  Hedging currency risk: An American manufacturer buying machines from Germany for which the payment is due in three months can remove price risk from the dollar–euro exchange rates by buying a currency forward contract.
	-  Hedging interest rate risk: A pension fund manager who is worried that her bond portfolio will get clobbered by rising interest rates can use Eurodollar futures (or options on those futures) to protect her portfolio.
	-  Protecting a portfolio against a market meltdown: A money manager whose port- folio has reaped huge gains can protect these gains by buying put options.
	-  Avoiding market restrictions: A trader can avoid short selling restrictions that an exchange might impose by taking a sell position in the options or the futures market.
	-  Ruining oneself: A wretch can gamble away his inheritance with derivatives.
